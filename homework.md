# Math 522 homework

[Submit with gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/170391)

## Week 1 (Due Tuesday, September 1)

1. (1.1) With the definition of $C+C'$ for Dedekind cuts, show that addition is commutative and associative.

2. (1.4) Show that any two complete ordered fields are isomorphic as ordered fields. [Hint: observe that both must contain a copy of $\Q$ which is dense.]

3. (2.1) Compute the sum of the lengths of all of the intervals removed from $[0,1]$ in the construction of the Cantor set. What if some fraction other than $1/3$ is removed at each stage?

4. (2.2) Prove proposition 2.4 in the notes: $A$ is nowhere dense iff $\bar A$ contains no intervals of positive-length iff $A$ is non-dense in every open set.
