# Math 522 resources

## Course notes

I am writing the course notes in parallel with the lectures, so they will be updated frequently. Your feedback is very welcome!

To save downloading and compiling `notes.tex`, you can use the following link to [view the notes](http://latex.aslushnikov.com/compile?git=http://github.com/scoskey/math522&target=notes.tex) online.

A significant part of the course notes will be drawn from Erik Holmes' senior thesis on this subject.

## Syllabus

The source of the syllabus is also available here. Again, use the following link to [view the syllabus](http://latex.aslushnikov.com/compile?git=http://github.com/scoskey/math522&target=syll.tex) online.
