   <h2 class='likechapterHead'><a id='x1-3000'></a>Introduction</h2>
<!-- l. 138 --><p class='noindent'>This course is about set theory, and its use in the study of the real line. By way of motivation,
consider the question of measuring the size of a given set of real numbers. The word “size” can
mean many different things, depending on the context. To see what I mean, consider these three
important examples.
</p>
           <ul class='itemize1'>
        <li class='itemize'>To a combinatorist or set theorist, the simplest notion of size is cardinality, which
        asks  for  instance  whether  a  set  is  finite,  countably  infinite,  or  uncountable.  Of
        course if the set is uncountable, a set theorist would further hope to distinguish
        whether  it  is  of  the  first  uncountable  cardinality  (\(\aleph _1\)),  the  second  uncountable
        cardinality (\(\aleph _2\)), etc.
           </li>
        <li class='itemize'>To  an  analyst,  one  standard  notion  of  size  is  measure,  which  asks  for  instance
        whether a set has zero length or positive length.
           </li>
        <li class='itemize'>To a topologist, a key notion of size is category, which asks whether a set is meager
        (topologically negligable), comeager, or else neither meager nor comeager.</li></ul>
<!-- l. 147 --><p class='indent'>   In this course we will ask the natural question: How do these three kinds of size compare
with one another? In answering this question, we will discover numerous relationships between
measure and category, with the diagram of these relationships revealing an intricate
structure.
</p><!-- l. 149 --><p class='indent'>   Our investigation of measure and category will lead us to a number of statements that are
independent of the axioms of set theory. Such statements cannot be proved true or false using the
usual axioms of set theory. The most central example of such a statement is the continuum
hypothesis (CH), which asserts that the set of all real numbers has cardinality equal to the first
uncountable cardinal number. Cantor initially posed this problem in 1878. In 1940 Gödel
showed the axioms of set theory can’t disprove CH, and in 1965 Cohen finally showed that the
axioms of set theory can’t prove CH.
</p><!-- l. 151 --><p class='indent'>   In his proof, Cohen developed a tool for building models of set theory called forcing. Far
from being an isolated application, Cohen’s contemporaries developed forcind into a general
tool for proving independence results. We will develop the machinery of forcing and give a
number of such applications.
</p><!-- l. 153 --><p class='indent'>   With the tool of forcing in hand, we will return to the notions of measure and category. We
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
will find that there are numerous cardinal numbers surrounding the zero length sets and the
meager sets whose values, like the size of the set of all real numbers, are independent of the
axioms of set theory.

   <h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>§1. </span> <a id='x1-50001'></a>The real number system</h3>
<!-- l. 166 --><p class='noindent'>Since we will be working with real numbers, we should begin with a definition of the real
number system. First we need some vocabulary surrounding fields.
</p>
   <div class='newtheorem'>
<!-- l. 168 --><p class='noindent'><span class='head'>
<a id='x1-5001r1'></a>
  1.1. Definition.  </span></p>
           <ul class='itemize1'>
        <li class='itemize'>Field:  A  set  \(F\)  together  with  distinguished  elements  \(0,1\),  operations  \(+,\times \),  satisfying  the
        associative, commutative, and distributive laws, \(0\) is the additive identity and \(1\) is
        the multiplicative identity;
           </li>
        <li class='itemize'>Ordered field: A field with a linear ordering \(&lt;\) satisfying \(a&lt;b\) implies \(a+c&lt;b+c\), and if \(c\) is positive
        then \(a&lt;b\) implies \(ac&lt;bc\);
           </li>
        <li class='itemize'>Complete field: if \(A\subset F\) has an upper bound, then it has a least upper bound (supremum).</li></ul>
   </div>
<!-- l. 174 --><p class='indent'>
</p><!-- l. 176 --><p class='indent'>   It is not difficult to prove that any two complete ordered fields are isomorphic to each other,
which means it makes sense for us to define the real number system as the unique such
object.
</p>
   <div class='newtheorem'>
<!-- l. 178 --><p class='noindent'><span class='head'>
<a id='x1-5002r2'></a>
  1.2. Definition.  </span>The real number system is the unique complete ordered field.
</p>
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
   </div>
<!-- l. 180 --><p class='indent'>
</p><!-- l. 182 --><p class='indent'>   Now this definition of the real number system is axiomatic—it tells you how real numbers
behave, but it leaves it up to your imagination what a real number really is. In fact, we have
some choice in this matter. One can construct real numbers using decimal strings, binary strings,
or even Cauchy sequences. For our set-theoretic purposes, all that matters is that we give one
construction of the real numbers that works.
</p><!-- l. 184 --><p class='indent'>   We will give the construction of the real numbers using cuts, which was proposed by
Dedekind in the 19th century. First, let’s take the construction of the rational number system for
granted. It is simply the set of fractions whose numerator is an integer and whose denominator
is a nonzero natural number.
</p><!-- l. 186 --><p class='indent'>   Now observe that each real number \(r\) cuts the rational numbers into two pieces: the
set of rational numbers that are strictly less than \(r\), and the set of rational numbers
that are greater than or equal to \(r\). Conversely, if I cut the rational numbers into two
pieces, there is a real number just in the middle of the cut (the supremum of the left
piece).
</p><!-- l. 188 --><p class='indent'>   This means that all we have to do to define real numbers is to define cuts. To avoid
circularity, we should axiomatize cuts without referring to real numbers at all. A cut in the
rational numbers is a subset \(C\subset \Q \) satisfying three properties:
</p>
           <ul class='itemize1'>
        <li class='itemize'>(nontriviality) \(C\neq \emptyset \) and \(C\neq \Q \)
           </li>
        <li class='itemize'>(downwards closure) if \(q\in C\) and \(q'&lt;q\) then \(q'\in C\)
           </li>
        <li class='itemize'>(no last element) if \(q\in C\) then there is \(q'&gt;q\) such that \(q'\in C\)</li></ul>
<!-- l. 196 --><p class='indent'>   To complete the construction one must say how the \(+,\times \) operations and \(&lt;\) relation can be defined
purely in terms of cuts, and then prove that they satisfy all the axioms of a complete ordered
field. For example, one defines \(C+C'\) as follows: \[C+C'=\set {q+q'\in \Q \mid q\in C,q'\in C'} \] Similarly one defines \(C&lt;C'\) if and only if \(C\subset C'\) and \(C\neq C'\). We omit
the details verifying that these definitions work.
</p>
   <div class='newtheorem'>
<!-- l. 201 --><p class='noindent'><span class='head'>
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
<a id='x1-5003r3'></a>
  1.3. Remark.  </span>It is interesting to compare Dedekind’s construction with the modern
decimal   number   construction.   The   decimal   number   construction   is   practical   for
calculations,  but  has  some  oddities.  For  example  some  numbers  have  two  decimal
representations, like \(.999\cdots \) and \(1.000\cdots \). Also we made an arbitrary decision to use decimal expansions
over other bases. Dedekind’s construction is beautiful because it is uniform and doesn’t
involve any arbitrary decisions.
</p>
   </div>
<!-- l. 203 --><p class='indent'>
</p><!-- l. 205 --><p class='indent'>   When studying the foundations of numbers, one often starts with the natural numbers, uses
differences to construct integers, then fractions to construct rational numbers, and finally
constructs the real numbers as above. It may seem as if these steps are all similar to one
another, but the final step is different. To see why we must introduce the idea of set
size.

  1.4. Definition.  </span>A set \(A\) of real numbers is said to be countable if its elements can be
enumerated using natural number indices. In other words, \(A\) is countable if there exists a
sequence \((a_n)_{n\in \N }\) such that \(A=\set {a_n\mid n\in \N }\).
</p>
   </div>
<!-- l. 209 --><p class='indent'>
</p><!-- l. 211 --><p class='indent'>   Note that in this terminology, a finite set is officially countable. If we wish to emphasize that
a particular countable set is infinite, we will use the term countably infinite. A set that is not

   Proof. </span>Suppose towards a contradiction that the set of all real numbers is countable.
Then there exists a sequence \((a_n)_{n\in \N }\) such that \(\R =\set {a_n\mid n\in \N }\). Our strategy will be to inductively construct a
decreasing sequence of closed intervals \(I_n=[l_n,r_r]\) such that for all \(n\), \(a_n\notin I_n\). Then if \(r\) lies in the intersection
of these intervals, \(r\) cannot be equal to \(a_n\) for any \(n\), a contradiction.
</p><!-- l. 223 --><p class='indent'>   The construction itself is straightforward. For the base case let \(I_1=[l_1,r_1]\) be any interval which
omits \(a_1\). For the inductive step, if \(I_{n-1}\) has been defined, let \(I_n=[l_n,r_n]\) be any subinterval of \(I_{n-1}\) which omits
\(a_n\).
</p><!-- l. 225 --><p class='indent'>   We can now find a point in the intersection of the \(I_n\) using the completeness property.
First observe that since \(I_n\subset I_{n-1}\) for all \(n\), the set of left endpoints \(\set {l_n\mid n\in \N }\) is bounded above by any and all
of the right endpoints \(r_n\). By the completeness property, the set of left endpoints has a least
upper bound \(x\). Since \(x\) is an upper bound for \(\set {l_n\mid n\in \N }\), we have \(l_n\leq x\) for all \(n\). Since \(x\) is the least possible
upper bound for \(\set {l_n\mid n\in \N }\), we have \(x\leq r_n\) for all \(n\). Therefore we have \(x\in [l_n,r_n]=I_n\) for all \(n\).
</p><!-- l. 227 --><p class='indent'>   Since \(x\) lies in \(I_n\) for all \(n\), and since we chose \(I_n\) in such a way that it omits \(a_n\), we know that \(x\neq a_n\)
for all \(n\). This contradicts the hypothesis that \(\R =\set {a_n\mid n\in \N }\), and concludes the proof. <span class='qed'>□</span>

<!-- l. 257 --><p class='noindent'>In the previous section we introduced the real numbers, and a cardinality-based notion of size
(countable and uncountable). In this section we introduce a topological notion of size. Intuitively
one might try to begin with denseness, but it doesn’t quite work. The reason is that some very
small sets are dense (like the rationals) and some very large sets are not dense (like the half-line
\([0,\infty )\)). Instead we need the following.

  2.1. Definition.  </span>A  set  of  real  numbers  \(A\)  is  said  to  be  nowhere  dense  if  every
positive-length interval \(I\) contains a positive-length interval \(J\) such that \(J\) is disjoint from \(A\).

  2.2. Example.  </span>Any finite subset of \(\R \) is nowhere dense. The set \(\set {1/n\mid n\in \N }\) is nowhere dense. In
fact, any discrete set is nowhere dense (here, \(A\) is discrete if every point of \(A\) is isolated). The
set of rational numbers whose numerator is \(1\) and whose denominator is a power of \(2\) is not
nowhere dense, because such a number can be found in every positive-length subinterval
of \([0,1]\).
</p>
   </div>
<!-- l. 265 --><p class='indent'>
</p><!-- l. 267 --><p class='indent'>   Note that nowhere dense sets need not be countable. The classical Cantor middle thirds set is
an archetypal example of a nowhere dense set. Recall that the Cantor set is defined as follows.
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
Begin with the set \(C_1=[0,1]\). Let \(C_2=[0,1/3]\cup [2/3,1]\) be the set \(C_1\) with its open middle third removed. Let \(C_3=[1,1/9]\cup [2/9,1/3]\cup [2/3,7/9]\cup [8/9,1]\) be the set \(C_2\) with the
open middle third removed from each component of \(C_2\). Refer to Figure <a href='#x1-60031'>2.f1<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:cantor-set  --></a> for a picture of these
first few sets. Recursively, let \(C_{n+1}\) be constructed from \(C_n\) by removing the open middle third from each
component of \(C_n\). Finally the Cantor set \(C\) is defined to be \(C=\bigcap C_n\). We will see in a later section that the
Cantor set is uncountable.

endpoints if necessary, we may suppose that \(J\) is open. It follows that \(J\subset \R \smallsetminus \cl (A)\) (recall that since \(\cl (A)\) is
the intersection of all closed sets containing \(A\), we have that \(\R \smallsetminus \cl (A)\) is the union of all open sets

<!-- l. 391 --><p class='noindent'>Classical measure theory aims to try to extend the length function on intervals to be defined on
more complicated sets. For example, if a given set is a finite or even countable union of intervals,
then it is appropriate to take the sum of the lengths of the components. But what about
more complex sets like the Cantor set? This was known as the measure problem: to
construct a measurement function \(m\), defined on sets of real numbers and valued in \([0,\infty ]\),
satisfying:
</p><!-- l. 393 --><p class='indent'>
           </p><ol class='enumerate1'>
        <li class='enumerate' id='x1-7002x1'>(normality) if \(I\) is an interval then \(m(I)=\ell (I)\)
           </li>
        <li class='enumerate' id='x1-7004x2'>(translation invariance) \(m(x+A)=m(A)\) for all sets \(A\) and real numbers \(x\)
           </li>
        <li class='enumerate' id='x1-7006x3'>(countable additivity) if \((A_n)_{n\in \N }\) is a sequence pairwise disjoint sets then \(m(\bigcup A_n)=\sum m(A_n)\)</li></ol>
<!-- l. 399 --><p class='indent'>   Perhaps surprisingly, the conditions (a)–(c) are mutually contradictory and so no such
measurement function \(m\) exists! Here is Vitali’s clever example of a contradiction arising from
these requirements. Regard \(\Q \) as an additive subgroup of \(\R \) and consider the cosets of \(\Q \), that is, sets
of the form \(x+\Q \). Let \(A\subset [0,1]\) be a set of coset representatives, that is, \(A\) contains exactly one element from each
of the cosets. (It is always possible to choose a coset representative in \([0,1]\) because \(\Q \) is
dense.)
</p><!-- l. 401 --><p class='indent'>   Then the translations \(q+A\) for \(q\in \Q \) form a countable sequence of pairwise disjoint sets that cover all of
\(\R \). In fact, if we let \(S=\Q \cap [-1,1]\) then the translations \(q+A\) for \(q\in S\) already cover all of \([0,1]\). We can then infer from (a) and
(c) that \(m[\bigcup _{q\in S}(q+A)]\) lies between \(1\) and \(3\). But on the other hand, by (b) and (c) we have that \[m\left (\bigcup _{q\in S}(q+A)\right )=\sum _{q\in S}m(q+A)=\sum _{q\in S}m(A) \] This is a
contradiction because an infinite sum of a single constant value \(m(A)\) must equal either \(0\) or \(\infty \), and so
cannot lie between \(1\) and \(3\).

necessary to build a nonmeasurable set.

</p><!-- l. 410 --><p class='indent'>   The contradiction described above is typically resolved not by dropping one of the
conditions (a)–(c), but rather by dropping the requirement that \(m\) is defined on all sets of real
numbers. The justification for this decision is that sets like the \(A\) constructed above
should be regarded as pathological, and we don’t usually need to measure them in
applications.
</p><!-- l. 412 --><p class='indent'>   Let us naïvely begin to construct a measure \(m\) that is at least defined on reasonable sets. First,
condition (a) implies we should let \(m(I)=\ell (I)\) for any interval \(I\). Next, if \(A=\bigcup I_n\) is a union of disjoint
intervals \(I_n\), then condition (c) implies we should let \(m(A)=\sum \ell (I_n)\). Third, if \(A=\bigcap A_n\) is an intersection of
sets where \(m\) is defined and finite, then it is natural to define \(m(A)=\inf m(A_n)\). We now observe that all
three of the above simple cases fit into the rule given by the following key formula:
\begin {equation} \label {eq:measure} m(A)=\inf \set {\sum \ell (I_n)\mid \text {$I_n$ are intervals and }A\subset \bigcup I_n} \end {equation}
The next result states that this rule for defining \(m\) actually works for all sets that are reasonably
constructible. Recall that a Borel set is one that can be constructed by beginning with the intervals
and then executing countably many countable unions or intersections.

   Proof of conditions (a) and (b) only. </span> For condition (a), let \(I\) be an interval. It is
clear that \(m(I)\leq \ell (I)\), since \(I\) itself is an interval covering \(I\). For the other direction, we will show that \(I\subset \bigcup I_n\)
implies \(\sum \ell (I_n)\geq \ell (I)\). Then taking the infemum over all such coverings this allows us to conclude that
\(m(I)\geq \ell (I)\).
</p><!-- l. 427 --><p class='indent'>   Let us first handle the case when \(I=[a,b]\) is closed and bounded, and all of the \(I_n\) are open
intervals \((a_n,b_n)\). Then since \(I\) is compact, \(I\) is covered by just finitely many of the \(I_n\), without loss
of generality we may assume they are indexed \(I_0,\ldots ,I_N\). Now after further renaming or removing
intervals from the list, we may suppose that \(I_0\) covers the left endpoint of \(I\), each \(I_{n+1}\) covers the
right endpoint of \(I_n\), and \(I_N\) covers the right endpoint of \(I\). We can now compute that \[\sum \ell (I_n) \geq \sum _0^N(b_n-a_n) \geq \sum _1^N(b_n-b_{n-1})-a \geq b-a = \ell (I)\text {.} \]
</p><!-- l. 435 --><p class='indent'>   If \(I\) is not necessarily closed and the \(I_n\) are not necessarily open, then we look instead at \(I'=\cl (I)\)
and \(I_n'=(I_n)^\circ \). Then the \(I_n'\) cover all but a countable subset of \(I'\), so for any \(\epsilon \) we can find additional open
intervals \(J_n\) with \(\ell (J_n)\leq \epsilon /2^n\) covering these missing points. Now the previous argument shows that \(\sum \ell (I_n)+\sum \ell (J_n)\geq \ell (I)\).
Using the geometric series formula we obtain \(\sum \ell (I_n)+\epsilon \geq \ell (I)\). Letting \(\epsilon \to 0\) we have the desired result.
</p><!-- l. 437 --><p class='indent'>   Finally if \(I\) is not bounded, we let \(A_k\) be a sequence of bounded subintervals of \(I\) such that
\(\ell (A_k)\to \infty \). The above result implies that \(\sum \ell (I_n)\geq \ell (A_k)\), and letting \(k\to \infty \) we once again achieve the desired result. This
concludes the proof of condition (a).
</p><!-- l. 439 --><p class='indent'>   Condition  (b)  follows  directly  from  the  fact  that  the  length  function  \(\ell \)  is  translation
invariant, and the definition of \(m\) depends only on \(\ell \).

<!-- l. 496 --><p class='noindent'>So far we have seen sets that are finite, countable, and uncountable. If a set \(A\) is finite, then there is
a natural number that corresponds to the number of elements of \(A\). If \(A\) is countable, we understand
that it has exactly as many elements as there are natural numbers. But if \(A\) is uncountable, is that
all that needs be said or is there some kind of number that tells us just how uncountable it
is?
</p><!-- l. 498 --><p class='indent'>   In this section we discuss the notion of “cardinality” of a set \(A\), which replaces the notion of
“number of elements” in the case when \(A\) is infinite. Notationally, we write \(|A|\) for the cardinality of \(A\).
When \(A\) is finite, \(|A|\) will be a natural number. When \(A\) is countable, \(|A|\) will be the value \(\aleph _0\) (pronounced
aleph zero, or aleph nought). And when \(A\) is uncountable \(|A|\) will be one of the values \(\aleph _1,\aleph _2\),
etc.
</p><!-- l. 500 --><p class='indent'>   We will now begin to describe several key properties of cardinality. Surprisingly, we can do
this without actually defining what the \(\aleph \)’s are! The following definition of how \(|\cdot |\) behaves is
sufficient for many practical purposes. In the next section we will give a formal definition of the
\(\aleph \)’s.

be  written  as  the  union  of  the  successive  differences  of  these  sets,  together  with  the
intersection of them all: \[A=(A\mathord {\smallsetminus }B)\cup (B\mathord {\smallsetminus }i(A)) \cup (i(A)\mathord {\smallsetminus }i(B))\cup \cdots \cup \bigcap i^n(A) \] Meanwhile, \(i\) provides bijections \[A\mathord {\smallsetminus }B\leftrightarrow i(A)\mathord {\smallsetminus }i(B)\leftrightarrow i^2(A)\mathord {\smallsetminus }i^2(B)\leftrightarrow \cdots \] It follows that the map \[f(a)=\begin {cases}i(a)&amp;\text {if }a\in (A\mathord {\smallsetminus }B)\cup (i(A)\mathord {\smallsetminus }i(B))\cup (i^2(A)\mathord {\smallsetminus }i^2(B))\cup \cdots \\ a&amp;\text {otherwise} \end {cases} \] is a

   Proof. </span>We argue very similarly to Theorem <a href='#x1-8006r6'>4.6<!-- tex4ht:ref: thm:card-total  --></a>, but in order to apply Zorn’s lemma
we must first suppose that \(\mathcal A\) really is a set. Fix any element \(A\in \mathcal A\) and let \[\mathcal F=\set {(f_B)_{B\in \mathcal A}\mid \text {there is $A_0\subset A$ such that for all $B$, $f_B$ is an injection from $A_0$ to $B$}} \] This time \(\mathcal F\) is partially
ordered  by  coordinatewise  extension  of  functions.  By  Zorn’s  lemma  there  is  a  maximal
element \((f_B)_{B\in \mathcal A}\), and since it is maximal either the domain \(A_0\) is all of \(A\) or the range of one of the
functions \(f_B\) is all of \(B\). In the first case \(f_B\) is an injection from \(A\) to \(B\) for all \(B\). In the second case, fix \(B\)
such that \(f_B(A_0)=B\). Then for any \(C\in \mathcal A\), the composition \(f_C\circ f_B^{-1}\) is an injection from \(B\) to \(C\), so \(B\) is as desired.
</p><!-- l. 593 --><p class='indent'>   In the general case when \(\mathcal A\) is a class, we can reduce to the set case as follows. Fix an
element \(D\in \mathcal A\) and let \(\mathcal A'\) denote the collection of subsets of \(D\) that are in bijection with some element
of \(\mathcal A\). Since \(\mathcal A'\) is a set, we can find \(A\in \mathcal A\) which injects into all elements of \(\mathcal A'\). It follows that \(A\) injects
into all other elements of \(\mathcal A\) too. Indeed if \(B\in \mathcal A\) and \(A\) does not inject into \(B\), then by Theorem <a href='#x1-8006r6'>4.6<!-- tex4ht:ref: thm:card-total  --></a>, \(B\)
injects into \(A\). It follows that \(B\) is in bijection with a subset of \(D\) and hence \(A\) injects into \(B\) after all.

<!-- l. 621 --><p class='noindent'>In the previous section we defined cardinal equality \(|A|=|B|\) and studied the order structure \(\leq \) of the
cardinal equality equivalence classes. In this section we finally define \(|A|\) by choosing a single
representative of \(A\)’s equivalence class. Specifically, we will define \(|A|\) to be the least ordinal number
in \(A\)’s equivalence class.
</p><!-- l. 623 --><p class='indent'>   Ordinal numbers play a central role in set theory, including both cardinality theory and
forcing. While cardinal numbers are needed to measure the size of an infinite set, ordinal
numbers are needed to measure the length of an infinite well-ordered set. The ordinals can be
used to extend the notion of counting into the infinite, and thus are an excellent choice to help us
define the cardinal numbers or \(\aleph \)’s.
</p><!-- l. 625 --><p class='indent'>   The initial goal in defining the ordinals is to provide a collection of well-ordered sets such
that for any given well-ordered set \(A\) there is one and only one ordinal \(\alpha \) such that \(A\) is
isomorphic to \(\alpha \). For finite well-ordered sets, we can write such a definition explicitly: \begin {align*} 0&amp;=\emptyset \\ 1&amp;=\{0\}\\ 2&amp;=\{0,1\}\\ \vdots \\ n+1&amp;=\{0,\ldots ,n\} \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 633 --><p class='indent'>   This construction can be summed up in one recurrence: \(n+1=n\cup \{n\}\). The first infinite ordinal, called \(\omega \) or \(\omega _0\),
is simply the union of all the finite ordinals. The process can then continue; the successor of \(\omega \) is
the ordinal \(\omega +1=\omega \cup \{\omega \}\).
</p><!-- l. 635 --><p class='indent'>   Intuitively, infinite ordinals are all constructed in this fashion. If \(\alpha \) is any ordinal then its
successor is \(\alpha +1=\alpha \cup \{\alpha \}\), and after infinitely many such steps we take a union. Unfortunately this
prescription is not rigorous because it is circular; we cannot make a definition like \(\alpha =\bigcup _{\beta &lt;\alpha }\beta \). Instead we
have the following more technical characterization.

   Proof. </span>It is easy to check \(\alpha =\beta \cup \{\beta \}\) is indeed an ordinal (it is transitive and well-ordered by \(\in \)).
Since the ordinals are well-ordered we may let \(\alpha '\) be the least ordinal greater than \(\beta \); we want
to show that \(\alpha =\alpha '\). If this were not the case, then by totality we would either have \(\alpha '\in \alpha \) or \(\alpha \in \alpha '\). In the
first case either \(\alpha =\beta \) or \(\alpha \in \beta \), which contradicts that \(\alpha '\) is greater than \(\beta \). The second case contradicts
that \(\alpha '\) is the least such.
</p><!-- l. 669 --><p class='indent'>   Next let \(\alpha \) be a limit ordinal, and let \(\alpha '\) be the union of all \(\beta \in \alpha \). Since \(\alpha \) is transitive we easily
have that \(\alpha '\subset \alpha \). On the other hand if \(\gamma \in \alpha \) then by the previous paragraph \(\gamma +1\leq \alpha \) and since \(\alpha \) is limit we
must have \(\gamma +1\in \alpha \). Thus \(\gamma \in \gamma +1\in \alpha \) and it follows that \(\gamma \in \alpha '\). <span class='qed'>□</span>
</p>
   </div>
<!-- l. 672 --><p class='indent'>   As we have hinted, although ordinals naturally measure the length of well-orderings,
they can also be used to measure size \(|A|\). Recall that the axiom of choice implies the
well-ordering principle, which states that any set \(A\) admits a well-ordering \(\leq \). Combining
this with Theorem <a href='#x1-9003r3'>5.3<!-- tex4ht:ref: thm:ordinals  --></a>, it follows that any set \(A\) is in bijection with at least one ordinal.
Different well-orderings of \(A\) can lead to different ordinals, so we make the following
definition.

</p>
   </div>
<!-- l. 676 --><p class='indent'>
</p><!-- l. 678 --><p class='indent'>   Thus a cardinal is a special type of ordinal. Most ordinals will not be cardinals, since for
instance if \(A\) is in bijection with \(\omega +7\) then clearly it is also in bijection with \(\omega \). We give \(\aleph \) names to the
ordinals which are cardinals: The first infinite cardinal is \(\aleph _0\), the first uncountable cardinal is \(\aleph _1\), the
next least cardinal is \(\aleph _2\), and so forth.
</p><!-- l. 680 --><p class='indent'>   The pattern continues transfinitely as well, with \(\aleph _\alpha \) defined for every ordinal \(\alpha \). Officially, these
higher cardinals are defined using transfinite recursion. Just as natural numbers are used to index
traditional recursion, ordinals are used to index transfinite recursion. While ordinary recursion
requires a special “base” case at \(n=0\), transfinite recursion requires a “limit” case at each limit
ordinal.

<!-- l. 716 --><p class='noindent'>If \(A\) is a countable set then \(A^\omega \) denotes the space of all sequences with values in \(A\), that is, functions
from \(\omega \) to \(A\). We can endow \(A^\omega \) with a topology by regarding \(A\) as discrete, \(A^\omega \) as a product of countably
many copies of \(A\), and using the product topology. The official definition of the product topology on
\(A^B\) states a basis consists of sets of the form \[\set {x\in A^B\mid x(b_0)\in A_0,\ldots ,x(b_{n-1})\in A_{n-1}} \] where \(b_i\in B\) are distinct and \(A_i\subset A\) are open. In the case of \(A^\omega \) we can
make two simplifications: since \(\omega \) is countable we can replace \(i_0,\ldots i_{n-1}\) with \(0,\ldots ,n-1\), and since \(A\) is discrete we can
assume the \(A_i\) are singletons. Putting this all together, \(A^\omega \) has a basis consisting of all \[V_s=\set {x\in A^\omega \mid s\subset x} \] where \(s\) is an
element of \(A^n\) for some \(n\).

   Proof. </span>We give the proof in the case of the Cantor space, and a brief hint in the case
of the Baire space.
</p><!-- l. 734 --><p class='indent'>   The Cantor middle thirds set \(C\) has a natural description in terms of ternary expansions.
If \(a\in [0,1]\) then \(a\) lies in the Cantor set if and only if it has a ternary expansion that does not contain
the digit \(1\). Thus there is a simple bijection \(2^\omega \to C\) given by replacing the \(1\)’s in \(x\) with \(2\)’s: \[f(x)=0.(2x(0))(2x(1))(2x(2))\cdots \] The map is
continuous: if \(f(x)\in (a,b)\) then there exists \(n\) such that if we round \(f(x)\) down at its \(n\)th digit then it is still \(&gt;a\)
and if we round it up at its \(n\)th digit then it is still \(&lt;b\). It follows that if \(s=x\restriction n\), then we have \(f(V_s)&gt;a\). Finally
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
recall that a continuous bijection between compact spaces is always a homeomorphism.
</p><!-- l. 739 --><p class='indent'>   For the Baire space, it is common to use the values of \(x\in (\omega \smallsetminus \{0\})^\omega \) as the entries in a continued
fraction: \[f(x)=x(0)+\cfrac {1}{x(1)+\cfrac {1}{x(2)+\cdots }} \] With some elementary number theory, it is possible to verify that this map is a
bijection onto the set of irrational numbers, and even a homeomorphism. <span class='qed'>□</span>

<!-- l. 745 --><p class='indent'>   This result also implies that \(2^\omega \) admits a complete metric, because the Cantor set is a closed and

   Proof. </span>Let \(x_i\) be a Cauchy sequence in \(A^\omega \). We can inductively construct an increasing
sequence of indices \(i_0,i_1,\ldots \) such that for all \(n\) and \(i\geq i_n\) we have \(d(x_{i_n},x_i)&lt;1/n\). In other words for \(i\geq i_0\) the \(x_i(0)\) all agree, for
\(i\geq i_1\) the \(x_i(1)\) all agree, etc. Thus we may define an element \(x\) by letting \(x(n)=\) this agreed upon value.
Now it is easy to check that \(x_i\to x\). <span class='qed'>□</span>

<!-- l. 755 --><p class='indent'>   It is not difficult to check this metric on \(A^\omega \) gives the same topology as the product

example, any reordering of \(\omega \) would give rise to a different metric compatible with the
toplogy.
</p><!-- l. 757 --><p class='indent'>   We now discuss a variety of topological properties in the context of sequence space. The
closed sets, nowhere dense sets, and compact sets all have special descriptions in sequence space
(compact sets are discussed in the next section).
</p><!-- l. 759 --><p class='indent'>   To begin, let \(A^{&lt;\omega }=\bigcup A^n\) denote the set of finite sequences of elements of \(A\). This set is partially
ordered by the subset relation, but we employ special terminology in this case. If \(s\subset t\) we say
that \(s\) is an initial segment of \(t\) or alternatively that \(t\) is an extension of \(s\). We use the same
terminology if \(s\in A^{&lt;\omega }\), \(x\in A^\omega \), and \(s\subset x\): \(s\) is a finite initial segment of \(x\), or \(x\) is an infinite extension of
\(s\).

is, all initial segments of elements of \(B\)). We will show that the set \([T_B]\) of all branches through
the tree \(T_B\) is precisely the closure of \(B\), which implies the desired result. For this, note that \(x\) lies
in the closure of \(B\) if and only if every open neighborhood of of \(x\) meets \(B\). This is equivalent
to the statement that for every initial segment \(s\subset x\), \(V_s\cap B\neq \emptyset \). Finally, this is equivalent to the statement
that \(x\) is a branch through \(T_B\). <span class='qed'>□</span>

we can define nowhere dense subsets of any topological space in terms of open sets: \(S\subset X\) is
nowhere dense in \(X\) if every open set has an open subset disjoint from \(S\). This definition can
even be made with basic open sets in place of open sets. Thus we have the following

<!-- l. 817 --><p class='noindent'>As we have discussed in the previous part, the exact cardinal value of the size of the set of all
real numbers is independent of the axioms of set theory. That is, if we write \(\mathfrak c=|\R |\) then we know \(\mathfrak c=\aleph _\alpha \) for
some \(\alpha \geq 1\), but we do not know which one. The letter \(\mathfrak c\) with its German font stands for continuum.
Since \(\mathfrak c\) is also equal to the cardinality of Cantor space \(2^\omega \), it is also often denoted \(2^{\aleph _0}\). In this section we
discuss several cardinal values other than \(\mathfrak c\) that arise from the special topology of the Baire space
\(\omega ^\omega \).
</p><!-- l. 819 --><p class='indent'>   We have measured the size of sets of real numbers using cardinality, category, and measure.

</p><!-- l. 821 --><p class='indent'>   Like the meager and null sets, the class of \(\sigma \)-compact sets is closed under countable unions.

we will show that if \(\mathcal I\) is a proper \(\sigma \)-ideal containing the singletons, then the additivity of \(\mathcal I\) is
a lower bound for all four cardinal characteristics of \(\mathcal I\), and hence all four are uncountable.
</p><!-- l. 974 --><p class='indent'>   Next,  it  is  easy  to  verify  that  for  any  proper  \(\sigma \)-ideal  \(\mathcal I\)  containing  the  singletons,  the

<!-- l. 977 --><p class='indent'>   All three of the \(\sigma \)-ideals we have introduced have a basis of Borel sets. For \(\Ksigma \) this is clear
because \(\sigma \)-compact sets are Borel. For \(\Meager \) any meager set is contained in a countable union of
closed nowhere dense sets, which are Borel. Finally for \(\Null \), note that if \(A\) is null then for all \(n\)
there is a Borel set \(A_n\) such that \(A\subset A_n\) and \(m(A_n)&lt;1/n\). It follows that \(A\) is contained in the Borel null set

   Proof. </span>For the inequality \(\add (\mathcal {I})\leq \non (\mathcal {I})\), we will show that for every set \(A\) not in \(\mathcal I\), we can find a
family \(\mathcal F\) of the same (or lower) cardinality such that \(\bigcup \mathcal F\notin I\). This is easy: if \(A\notin \mathcal I\), then the family \(\mathcal F\)
consisting of all \(\{a\}\) such that \(a\in A\) has the same cardinality as \(A\) and satisfies \(\bigcup \mathcal F\notin \mathcal I\).
</p><!-- l. 994 --><p class='indent'>   The proofs of each of the next three inequalities follows the same form: given a set
indicated by the right-hand side, find a set of the same or lower cardinality indicated by
the left-hand side. So to show \(\non (\mathcal I)\leq \cof (\mathcal I)\), let \(\mathcal F\subset \mathcal {I}\) be a basis for \(\mathcal I\). For each set \(B\in \mathcal F\) choose an element \(x_B\notin B\) and let
\(A=\set {x_B\mid B\in \mathcal F}\). Then \(A\) has the same or lower cardinality as \(\mathcal F\), and we claim that \(A\notin \mathcal {I}\). Indeed if \(A\in \mathcal {I}\) then we would
have \(A\subseteq B\) for some \(B\in \mathcal F\), contradicting that \(x_B\notin B\).
</p><!-- l. 996 --><p class='indent'>   For the inequality \(\add (\mathcal I)\leq \cov (\mathcal I)\), if \(\mathcal F\subset \mathcal {I}\) satisfies \(\bigcup \mathcal F=X\), then \(\mathcal F\) itself satisfies \(\bigcup \mathcal F\notin \mathcal I\).
</p><!-- l. 998 --><p class='indent'>   For the inequality \(\cov (\mathcal I)\leq \cof (\mathcal I)\), again suppose that \(\mathcal F\) is a basis for \(\mathcal I\). Since \(\mathcal I\) contains the singletons, it

<!-- l. 1047 --><p class='noindent'>So far we have seen many similarities between the various size notions that we have
discussed. The classes of meager sets and null sets are both ideals, both proper, both closed
under countable unions, and so on. In this section we further investigate how far this
comparison extends, and in the process we reveal a deep connection between measure and
category.
</p><!-- l. 1049 --><p class='indent'>   To begin, it is natural to ask whether the meager and null sets are truly different notions.
The following result shows that they are very different indeed: it is possible to be
small according to one of the notions, and at the same time, large according to the
other.

</p>
   <div class='proof'>
<!-- l. 1056 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='head'>
   Proof. </span>The key is that we can construct dense open sets of arbitrarily small measure.
That is, for each \(n\) we will construct a dense open set \(A_n\) such that \(m(A_n)&lt;1/n\). Assuming we have done
so, we let \(A=\bigcap A_n\). Clearly the set \(A\) is null. To see that it is comeager note that for all \(n\), we have that
\(\R \smallsetminus A_n\) is closed and nowhere dense. Thus \(\R \smallsetminus A=\bigcup (\R \smallsetminus A_n)\) is meager.
</p><!-- l. 1058 --><p class='indent'>   To construct the set \(A_n\), let \(q_0,q_1,\ldots \) be an enumeration of the rational numbers, and for each \(i\) let
\(I_{n,i}\) be the open interval centered at \(q_i\) of length \(1/(n2^{i+1})\). We then let \(A_n=\bigcup _iI_{n,i}\). Clearly \(A_n\) is dense and open, and
\(m(A_n)\leq \sum _i1/(n2^{i+1})=1/n\).
</p><!-- l. 1060 --><p class='indent'>   Finally, since \(A\) is null and comeager, we clearly have that \(\R \smallsetminus A\) is meager and conull. <span class='qed'>□</span>
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
</p>
   </div>
<!-- l. 1063 --><p class='indent'>   Although this result shows that category and measure are very different in terms of which
sets they deem small, it also provides a certain symmetry between the two notions. The
next result breaks this symmetry, and in its place provides an intricate structure of
relationships between category and measure. This result is what we came all this way to
see.

  9.3. Remark.  </span>In Cichoń’s diagram, the \(\Meager \) symbol can stand for the meager ideal on
any one of the spaces \(\R \), \(2^\omega \), or \(\omega ^\omega \). Indeed, we have already seen in Proposition <a href='#x1-10001r1'>6.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: prop:cantor-baire-homeo  --></a> that \(\R \) and \(\omega ^\omega \)
can be made homeomorphic after removing a countable subset of each. In Exercise <a href='#x1-14007r1'>9.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: exerc:meager-bij  --></a>,
we show that the same is true of \(\R \) and \(2^\omega \).
</p><!-- l. 1091 --><p class='indent'>   Similarly, the \(\Null \) symbol can stand for the null ideal on either \(\R \) or \(2^\omega \); see Exercise <a href='#x1-14008r2'>9.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: exerc:null-bij  --></a>. In
fact, it is possible to define a natural measure on \(\omega ^\omega \), and then \(\Null \) can stand for the null ideal on
\(\omega ^\omega \) too. [ref]

<!-- l. 1093 --><p class='indent'>
</p><!-- l. 1095 --><p class='indent'>   Theorem <a href='#x1-14002r2'>9.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: thm:cichon  --></a> doesn’t rule out the possibility that all or some of the cardinals in Cichoń’s
diagram are equal to each other. And this is indeed possible: if CH is true then \(\aleph _1=\mathfrak c\) and so all twelve of
the cardinals are identical. So to truly break the symmetry between category and measure, we
need some way to show that it is possible for these cardinals to be different. For that
we will need the method of forcing, which will be the focus of the second half of the
course.
</p><!-- l. 1097 --><p class='indent'>   For the rest of this section as well as the next few, we take up the proof of Theorem <a href='#x1-14002r2'>9.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: thm:cichon  --></a>. We
have already established seven out of the fifteen inequalities depicted: \(\mathfrak b\leq \mathfrak d\) follows from
Proposition <a href='#x1-12008r8'>7.8<!-- tex4ht:ref: prop:bd  --></a>. The two bounds \(\aleph _1\leq \add (\Null )\) and \(\cof (\Null )\leq \mathfrak c\) follow from Lemma <a href='#x1-13003r3'>8.3<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:ideal-cards  --></a>. And four more of the
inequalities are special cases of Lemma <a href='#x1-13005r5'>8.5<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:diamond  --></a>.
</p><!-- l. 1099 --><p class='indent'>   We conclude this section with proofs of four more fairly easy inequaleties. The remaining
four turn out to be be slightly more difficult. In the next section we will present a handy but
abstract tool that will reduce our workload to just two more inequalities. The final two will be
proved in the following two sections.

   <div class='proof'>
<!-- l. 1107 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='head'>
   Proof. </span>For  the  first  inequality,  recall  our  observation  in  Remark <a href='#x1-12004r4'>7.4<!-- tex4ht:ref: rem:ksigma-meager  --></a>  that  \(\Ksigma \subset \Meager \),  so  any
nonmeager subset of \(\omega ^\omega \) is certainly not \(\Ksigma \). But we also know that every non-\(\Ksigma \) set is unbounded.
It follows that every nonmeager subset of \(\omega ^\omega \) is unbounded, which implies \(\mathfrak b\leq \non (\Meager )\).
</p><!-- l. 1109 --><p class='indent'>   The second inequality again uses the fact that \(\Ksigma \subset \Meager \), and we leave it as Exercise <a href='#x1-14009r3'>9.3<!-- tex4ht:ref: exerc:covm-d  --></a>. <span class='qed'>□</span>

   <div class='proof'>
<!-- l. 1118 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='head'>
   Proof. </span>For the first inequality, we must show that given a nonmeager set \(X\), we can
find a family \(\mathcal F\) of null sets of smaller or equal size such that \(\bigcup F=\R \). For this, we let \(A\) be the null
comeager set constructed in Proposition <a href='#x1-14001r1'>9.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: prop:null-comeager  --></a>, and consider the family of null sets \(\mathcal F=\set {x+A\mid x\in X}\).
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
</p><!-- l. 1120 --><p class='indent'>   To see that \(\bigcup F=\R \), suppose towards a contradiction that this is not the case. Then there exists
\(z\in \R \) such that \(z\notin x+A\) for all \(x\in X\). It follows that \(z-x\notin A\) for all \(x\in X\), or in other words that \(z-X\) is disjoint from \(A\). But \(A\) is
comeager, so this would imply that \(z-X\) is meager, which is a contradiction.
</p><!-- l. 1122 --><p class='indent'>   The proof of the second inequality is identical but with the terms meager and null
exchanged.  This  time  let  \(X\)  be  nonmeager,  and  let  \(A\)  be  meager  conull.  Then  the  same
argument shows that the family \(\mathcal F\) defined above covers \(\R \), since otherwise there would be a
translate \(z-X\) of \(X\) which is null. <span class='qed'>□</span>

   Proof. </span>For the first statement, we simply chase the diagram: since \(\mathcal F\) is \(R\)-dominating,
for any \(d\in \dom (S)\) there exists \(f\in \mathcal F\) such that \(\phi (d)\mathrel {R}f\). Since \((\phi ,\psi )\) is a morphism, it follows that \(d\mathrel {S}\psi (f)\). This confirms that \(\psi (\mathcal F)\)
is an \(S\)-dominating family.
</p><!-- l. 1217 --><p class='indent'>   The second statement follows from the first, together with the fact that the image \(\psi (\mathcal F)\) has
the same or smaller cardinality than \(\mathcal F\).

   Proof. </span>\((\Leftarrow )\) We show that \(\Diff _P(x)\) is meager. Let \[A_N=\set {y\in 2^\omega \mid (\forall n\geq N)\;y\restriction I_n\neq x\restriction I_n}\text {.} \] Then \(\Diff _P(x)=\bigcup A_N\), and it is not difficult to check that the \(A_N\)
are closed and have empty interior.
</p><!-- l. 1289 --><p class='indent'>   \((\Rightarrow )\) Suppose \(A=\bigcup A_n\) where each \(A_n\) is nowhere dense, and assume without loss of generality that \(A_n\subset A_{n+1}\)
for all \(n\). We will define an interval partition \(P=(I_n)\) and an element \(x\in 2^\omega \) recursively. To begin, since \(A_0\)
isn’t dense there exists \(s\in 2^{&lt;\omega }\) such that \(A_0\cap V_s=\emptyset \). We let \(I_0=\dom (s)\) and \(x\restriction I_0=s\).
</p><!-- l. 1291 --><p class='indent'>   Now suppose that \(I_i\) and \(x\restriction I_i\) have been constructed for \(i&lt;n\) and let \(s=x\restriction \bigcup _{i&lt;n}I_i\) be the initial segment of \(x\)
built so far. Since \(A_n\) is nowhere dense, by Proposition <a href='#x1-10004r4'>6.4<!-- tex4ht:ref: prop:cantor-space-nwd  --></a> we can find an extension \(t\) of \(s\) such
that \(A_n\cap V_t=\emptyset \). But we can do even better: we can find an extension \(t\) of \(s\) such that even if \(y\in 2^\omega \) only agrees
with \(t\) on \(\dom (t\smallsetminus s)\), then we still have \(y\notin A_n\).
</p><!-- l. 1293 --><p class='indent'>   Such a \(t\) is built in \(k\) many steps: Let \(s_0,\ldots ,s_{k-1}\) enumerate all elements of \(2^{&lt;\omega }\) whose domain is exactly
\(\dom (s)\). Repeatedly using that \(A_n\) is nowhere dense, we can find a sequence of successive extensions
\(s\subset t_0\subset \ldots \subset t_{k-1}=t\) such that \(A_n\cap V_{s_i\cup (t_i\smallsetminus s)}=\emptyset \). We then let \(I_n=\dom (t\smallsetminus s)\) and \(x_n=t\restriction I_n\). This concludes the construction of \(x\) and \(P\).
</p><!-- l. 1295 --><p class='indent'>   To see that \(A\subset \Diff _P(x)\), observe that whenever \(y\restriction I_n=x\restriction I_n\) we have \(y\notin A_n\). In other words, whenever \(y\in A_n\) we have that
\(y\) differs from \(x\) on \(I_n\). Since the \(A_n\) are increasing, any \(a\in A\) lies in all but finitely many of the \(A_n\). Thus
we can conclude that any \(a\in A\) strongly differs from \(x\) on \(P\). <span class='qed'>□</span>

define  the  element  \(\psi (P)\in \omega ^\omega \)  by  \(\psi (P)(n)=\)  the  right  endpoint  of  the  interval  after  the  one  containing  \(n\).
Moreover for any function \(f\in \omega ^\omega \) define an interval partition \(\phi (f)\) consisting of intervals \([a,b]\) such that \(\max \{f(n)\mid n&lt;a\}\leq b\).
</p><!-- l. 1314 --><p class='indent'>   Now, if \(\phi (f)\prec P=(I_m)\), we must verify that \(f\leq ^*\psi (P)\). Indeed, given any \(n\) we may find \(I_m\) such that \(n\in I_m\). Then if \(n\) is
large enough, since \(\phi (f)\prec P\) we know there exists an interval \(J\in \phi (f)\) such that \(J\subset I_{n+1}\). Then by definition of \(\phi \) we
have \(f(n)\leq \max J\). And by definition of \(\psi \) we have \(\max J\leq \psi (P)(n)\). Hence \(f(n)\leq \psi (P)(n)\), as desired.

   Proof. </span>We have already shown that \(\add (\Meager )\leq \mathfrak b\) and \(\add (\Meager )\leq \cov (\Meager )\). Hence it remains only to show that \(\add (\Meager )\geq \min \{\mathfrak b,\cov (\Meager )\}\). For
this we must show that if \(\mathcal F\) is a family of meager subsets of \(\omega ^\omega \) such that \(|\mathcal F|&lt;\min \{\mathfrak b,\cov (\Meager )\}\) then \(\bigcup \mathcal F\) is meager.
Without loss of generality, we can suppose that \(\mathcal F\) consists of closed nowhere dense sets.
</p><!-- l. 1340 --><p class='indent'>   We begin by finding a countable dense subset \(Q\subset \omega ^\omega \) disjoint from \(\bigcup \mathcal F\). Indeed, since \(|\mathcal F|&lt;\cov (\Meager )\) we have
that \(\bigcup \mathcal F\neq \omega ^\omega \). In fact for any basic open set \(V_s\) we must have that \(\bigcup \mathcal F\) does not cover \(I\), since otherwise
we could use Exercise <a href='#x1-16008r2'>11.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: exerc:homeo  --></a> to find a countable family of translates of \(\bigcup \mathcal F\) which covers all of
\(\omega ^\omega \). This shows \(\bigcup \mathcal F\) is co-dense, and therefore we can find \(Q\) as required.
</p><!-- l. 1342 --><p class='indent'>   Now enumerate \(Q=(q_n)_{n\in \N }\). Then for each \(F\in \mathcal F\) and \(n\in \N \), since \(F\) is nowhere dense, we can find a finite
initial segment \(q_n\restriction g_F(n)\) such that \(V_{q_n\restriction g_F(n)}\) is disjoint from \(F\). Since \(|\mathcal F|&lt;\mathfrak b\), the family of functions \(\set {g_F\mid F\in \mathcal F}\) is bounded by a
single function \(h\in \omega ^\omega \). Finally we use this \(h\) to define the set: \[R=\bigcap _N\bigcup _{n\geq N}V_{q_n\restriction h(n)}\text {.} \] Then \(R\) is a countable intersection of
dense open sets, and hence it is comeager. Moreover since for all \(F\in \mathcal F\) we have \(g_F\leq ^*h\), we have that \(R\)
is disjoint from \(\bigcup \mathcal F\). We can thus conclude that \(\bigcup \mathcal F\) is meager, as desired. <span class='qed'>□</span>

<!-- l. 1348 --><p class='indent'>   Although the last result does not apparently involve a morphism, it is true that an analogous

<!-- l. 1371 --><p class='noindent'>In this section we complete the proof of the last two inequalities remaining in Cichoń’s
diagram: \(\add (\Null )\leq \add (\Meager )\) and \(\cof (\Meager )\leq \cof (\Null )\). By duality, the two inequalities are really one that was discovered independently
by Bartoszyński and Raisonnier–Stern. The proof we give is mostly due to Bartoszyński, and is
markedly more difficult than our previous results. In fact I will need your help proving two of
the preparatory facts (see the exercises).
</p><!-- l. 1373 --><p class='indent'>   We begin by introducing a new relation that will sit between \(\cof (\Null )\) and \(\cof (\Meager )\). A slalom is a sequence \(S=(I_n)\) of
subsets \(I_n\subset \omega \) such that \(|I_n|\leq 2^n\). We write \(SL\) for the set of slaloms. An element \(f\in \omega ^\omega \) is said to ski through \(S\), which we
denote by \(f\in ^*S\), if for almost every \(n\) we have \(f(n)\in I_n\).

   Proof of Lemma <a href='#x1-17001r1'>12.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:null-slalom  --></a>. </span> We must define \(\phi \colon \omega ^\omega \to \Null \) and \(\psi \colon \Null \to SL\) such that for all \(f\in \omega ^\omega \) and null sets \(A\subset 2^\omega \) we
have \(\phi (f)\subset A\) implies \(f\in ^*\psi (A)\).
</p><!-- l. 1390 --><p class='indent'>   To define \(\phi \), we start with a sequence of open subsets \(E_{n,i}\subset 2^\omega \) such that \(m(E_{n,i})=2^{-n}\), and given \(f\in \omega ^\omega \) we let \[\phi (f)=\bigcap _N\bigcup _{n\geq N} E_{n,f(n)}\text {.} \] Then
it is clear that \(\phi (f)\) is a null set. For technical reasons later on, we will need to assume that the
sets \(E_{n,i}\) are mutually independent events (the measure of an intersection is the product of the
measures). It is possible to write down such \(E_{n,i}\) explicitly.
</p><!-- l. 1395 --><p class='indent'>   Let us preview a strategy for defining \(\psi \). Given a null set \(A\) such that \(\phi (f)\subset A\), we must produce
the desired slalom \(\psi (A)\). Let \(K\) be chosen as in Proposition <a href='#x1-17002r2'>12.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: prop:self-supporting  --></a>, so that in particular \(K\cap \bigcap _N\bigcup _{n\geq N}E_{n,f(n)}=\emptyset \). Since \(K\) is
complete and the sets \(\bigcup _{n\geq N}E_{n,f(n)}\) are open, the Baire category theorem implies that at least one of
them is non-dense in \(K\). Thus there is a basic open set \(V_s\) such that \(V_s\cap K\neq \emptyset \) and \(V_s\cap K\cap \bigcup _{n\geq N}E_{n,f(n)}=\emptyset \). We want to define
the slalom \(\psi (A)=(I_n)\) so that \(I_n\) includes all \(i\) with \(V_s\cap K\cap \bigcup _{n\geq N}E_{n,i}=\emptyset \), and therefore obtain \(f\in ^*\psi (A)\).
</p><!-- l. 1397 --><p class='indent'>   As a first approximation to this, whenever \(V_s\cap K\neq \emptyset \) we set \[I_n(s)=\set {i\in \omega \mid V_s\cap K\cap E_{n,i}=\emptyset } \] and otherwise we simply let \(I_n(s)=\emptyset \). We now
have two issues to deal with: </p>
           <ul class='itemize1'>
        <li class='itemize'>To be a slalom, \((I_n)\) must satisfy \(|I_n|\leq 2^n\), and the \(I_n(s)\) don’t necessarily have this property; and
           </li>
        <li class='itemize'>We need a single slalom \((I_n)\) that doesn’t depend on \(s\).</li></ul>
<!-- l. 1406 --><p class='indent'>   Tackling the first issue, we will show that the sets \(|I_n(s)|\) are not too large. More specifically we
claim that the sum \(\sum 2^{-n}|I_n(s)|\) converges. Indeed, by the independence of the sets \(E_{n,i}\) we have \[m(V_s\cap K)\leq \prod _{n\in \N ,i\in I_n(s)}m((E_{n,i})^c) =\prod _{n\in \N }(1-2^{-n})^{|I_n(s)|}\text {.} \] By our choice
of \(K\), the left-hand side is positive. Hence the right-hand side is positive too and taking a
logarithm we obtain \[\sum -\log (1-2^{-n})|I_n(s)|&lt;\infty \] From the Taylor series expansion we always have \(-\log (1-x)&gt;x\), and the claim now
follows.
</p><!-- l. 1415 --><p class='indent'>   To deal with the second issue, we construct a single slalom \(I_n\) such that for all \(s\) we eventually
have \(I_n(s)\subset I_n\). To do this fix an enumeration \(s_1,s_2,\ldots \) of the elements of \(2^{&lt;\omega }\). By the claim from the previous
paragraph we can find \(k(s_j)\) such that for all \(n\geq k(s_j)\) we have \(2^{-n}|I_n(s_j)|\leq 1/2^j\). We then let \(I_n=\bigcup \set {I_n(s_j)\mid n\geq k(s_j)}\). Then clearly \[|I_n|\leq \sum _{k(s_j)\leq n}|I_n(s_j)|\leq \sum _{j}2^n/2^j\leq 2^n\text {.} \] Thus \(\psi (A)=(I_n)\) is a slalom,
and this completes the construction of \(\psi \).
</p><!-- l. 1420 --><p class='indent'>   To recapitulate why this works, again suppose that \(\phi (f)\subset A\). By our original reasoning we can find \(V_s\)
such that \(V_s\cap K\neq \emptyset \) and for almost all \(n\), \(V_s\cap K\cap E_{n,f(n)}=\emptyset \). Thus for \(n\) large enough we have both \(f(n)\in I_n(s)\) and \(I_n(s)\subset I_n\). It follows that \(f\in ^*\psi (A)\).

   <h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>§13. </span> <a id='x1-1900013'></a>The idea of forcing</h3>
<!-- l. 1504 --><p class='noindent'>In this part, we will assume familiarity with the notions of statement, theory, and model. As a
reminder, a formula is simply a mathematical assertion that can be expressed using the
ordinary logical symbols (and, or, not, quantifiers, variables) and non-logical symbols (in
our case, \(\in \), \(\cup \), \(\mathcal P\), etc). A sentence is a formula in which every variable is quantified, and
a theory is a collection of sentences. If \(T\) is a theory, then a model of \(T\) is a set, together
with interpretations of the non-logical symbols of \(T\), in which all the sentences in \(T\) hold
true.
</p><!-- l. 1506 --><p class='indent'>   We are interested in the theory ZFC, which consists of the standard axioms for set theory,
that govern how the \(\in \) relation behaves. Gödel’s incompleteness theorem implies that for some
sentences \(\phi \), the models of ZFC do not all agree about whether \(\phi \) is true or false. A theorem is a
sentence that is true in every model of ZFC. An independent statement is a sentence that is true in
some models, and false in others. One example that we have mentioned already is CH, the
sentence which says that \(\mathfrak c=\aleph _1\).
</p><!-- l. 1510 --><p class='indent'>   Forcing is a method of adding new sets to a given model \(V\) of ZFC, to obtain a larger model \(W\) of
ZFC. By carefully choosing how we add the new sets, we may be able to force a given statement
to hold true in \(W\). For example if \(\mathcal F\subset \omega ^\omega \), it is possible to add a new element \(g\in \omega ^\omega \) that is a bound for \(\mathcal F\), even if \(\mathcal F\)
was unbounded to begin with. This is a powerful move, and when iterated it can have an effect
on the value of the cardinal \(\mathfrak b\).
</p><!-- l. 1512 --><p class='indent'>   But forcing cannot do just anything. For a very simple example, if \(A\neq \emptyset \), then \(A\) will remain
nonempty after forcing. There is some element \(a\in A\) and this element will remain in \(A\) forever. More
generally, we will see that a wide variety of statements are absolute, meaning that their truth
value cannot be changed by forcing. The Riemann hypothesis is an example of such a
statement.
</p><!-- l. 1514 --><p class='indent'>   The concept of absoluteness highlights the distinction between ordinals and cardinals. Recall
that an ordinal is a set which is transitive and well-ordered by the \(\in \) relation. Both of these
properties are absolute, and therefore forcing can never change what is and isn’t an ordinal. On
the other hand, \(\aleph _1\) is defined to be the least ordinal that cannot be mapped injectively into \(\omega \). So \(\aleph _1\) is
equal to some ordinal \(\alpha \), but it may change to be equal to some other ordinal \(\beta \) after a forcing which
adds a new injection from \(\alpha \) to \(\omega \).
</p><!-- l. 1516 --><p class='indent'>   The situtation is even more fluid with an indirectly-defined cardinal such as \(\mathfrak c\). Recall that \(\mathfrak c\) is
the unique cardinal number \(\aleph _\alpha \) that is in bijection with \(2^\omega \). This value can be raised by a
forcing which adds at least \(\aleph _{\alpha +1}\) many new subsets of \(\omega \). The value can also be shrunk by a
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
forcing which adds a new bijection between \(\aleph _1\) and the old \(\aleph _\alpha \) (while still preserving \(\aleph _1\)).
Roughly speaking, this is how we will establish the independence of the continuum
hypothesis.
</p><!-- l. 1518 --><p class='indent'>   For the rest of this section we introduce the basic combinatorial objects used in forcing. The
main object is very simple: a forcing notion is simply a partial order \(\PP \) with a maximum element \(\mathbb 1\)
(also written \(\mathbb 1_\PP \)). When we force with \(\PP \), we add a new subset of \(\PP \) to the universe. We think of the
elements of \(\PP \) as imposing conditions on the new set to be added. If \(p,q\in \PP \) we say that \(p\) is stronger than \(q\) if
\(p\leq q\); lower elements hold more information.
</p><!-- l. 1520 --><p class='indent'>   When we force with \(\PP \), the partial order \(\PP \) can give fine control over the new subset that we
add.

dense, since any \(s\in \omega ^{&lt;\omega }\) can be extended to an element with length at least \(n\) (recall we are using
the upside-down ordering). It follows that \(G\) meets \(D_n\) for all \(n\), and hence that \(G\) is an infinite
path. Second, if \(G\) is \(V\)-generic then we have already seen that \(G\notin V\). Thus the union \(g=\bigcup G\) is an element
of \(\omega ^{&lt;\omega }\) that wasn’t there before, that is, \(g\) is a new element of the Baire space! We can do the

<!-- l. 1586 --><p class='noindent'>We will make the ideas of the previous section more rigorous shortly. But before going into the
technical details of this, we will introduce the combinatorics of forcing using forcing itself as a
black box. Specifically, we will appeal to a statement called Martin’s axiom, which roughly
speaking says that the current universe of set theory \(V\) already contains many highly generic
filters \(G\). The consistency of MA is itself proved using forcing, but we shall take this for granted
for now. This will allow us to explore the effects of forcing using a number of partial orders
without ever leaving \(V\).
</p><!-- l. 1588 --><p class='indent'>   There is unfortunately one major limitation on the variety of partial orders we will be able to
explore using Martin’s axiom. A subset \(A\subset \PP \) is said to be an antichain if for all \(p,q\in A\) we have \(p\) and \(q\) are not
compatible. Thus if \(A\) is an antichain, a filter \(G\) can only choose at most one of the elements of
\(A\).

consider the family of sets \[D_{f,n}=\set {s\in \omega ^{&lt;\omega }\mid \text {there is $n'&gt;n$ such that $s(n')&gt;f(n')$}}\text {.} \] Observe that \(D_{f,n}\) is dense for all \(f\) and \(n\): if \(s\in \omega ^{&lt;\omega }\) we can easily find \(n'&gt;\max (n,|s|)\) and
find \(t\supset s\) such that \(t(n')&gt;f(n')\). Thus by MA we can find a filter \(G\) which meets \(D_{f,n}\) for all \(f\in \mathcal F\) and \(n\in \N \). Letting \(g=\bigcup G\), it is

   Proof. </span>Suppose towards a contradiction that \(\mathcal F\) is an unbounded family of size \(&lt;\mathfrak c\), and
let \(\PP \) be the Hechler forcing \(\mathbb H_{\mathcal F}\). We now consider two families of dense sets. First, for each \(n\) we
consider the set \[D_n=\set {(s,F)\in \mathbb H_{\mathcal F}\mid n\in \dom (s)}\text {.} \] To see that \(D_n\) is dense, let \((s,F)\) be a given element of \(\mathbb H_{\mathcal F}\). If \(n\notin \dom (s)\) then we extend the
stem \(s\) to a sequence \(t\) defined by \(t(i)=\max _{f\in F}f(i)+1\) for all \(i\notin \dom (s)\) such that \(i\leq n\). Then clearly \((t,F)\leq (s,F)\) and \((t,F)\in D_n\).
</p><!-- l. 1726 --><p class='indent'>   Next, for each \(f\in \mathcal F\) we consider the set \[D_f=\set {(s,F)\in \mathbb H_{\mathcal F}\mid f\in F}\text {.} \] Then \(D_f\) is again dense, since given \((s,F)\) we have \((s,F\cup \{f\})\leq (s,F)\) (Observe
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
that the promises \(F\) are trivially satisfied since we have not lengthened the stem!)
</p><!-- l. 1731 --><p class='indent'>   Now by MA we cand find a filter \(G\) that meets \(D_n\) for all \(n\in \N \) and \(D_f\) for all \(f\in \mathcal F\). We then let \[g=\bigcup \set {s\mid (\exists F)\;(s,F)\in G} \] be the
element of the Baire space determined by \(G\). Given \(f\in \mathcal F\) and \(N\in \N \) we first find an element \((s,F)\in G\cap D_f\), and then
letting \(n=\max (N,|s|)\) we find an element \((s',F')\in G\cap D_n\). Since \(G\) is a filter we can find \((s'',F'')\in G\) which is stronger than both. Then
by the definition of the ordering on \(\mathbb H_{\mathcal F}\), \(s''(n)&gt;f(n)\) and hence \(g(n)&gt;f(n)\). Since \(f\) and \(N\) were arbitrary, it follows that
\(f\leq ^*g\) for all \(f\in \mathcal F\), contradicting that \(\mathcal F\) is unbounded. <span class='qed'>□</span>

   Proof. </span>Given an uncountable family \(\mathcal F\subset \mathbb A_\epsilon \) we must show that at least two elements \(O,O'\in \mathcal F\) are
compatible,  that  is,  \(m(O\cup O')&lt;\epsilon \).  We  first  give  ourselves  a  little  wiggle  room  as  follows:  since  \(\mathcal F\)  is
uncountable and there are only countably many values of \(n\in \N \), by the pigeon-hole principle
we can find a fixed \(n\) and an uncountable subset \(\mathcal F_0\subset \mathcal F\) such that for all \(O\in \mathcal F_0\) we have \(m(O)&lt;\epsilon -1/n\).
</p><!-- l. 1753 --><p class='indent'>   Now for each \(O\in \mathcal F_0\) we can find an open set \(B_O\subset O\) which is a finite union of intervals with rational

we can find a fixed set \(B\) and an uncountable \(\mathcal F_{00}\subset \mathcal F_0\) such that \(B=B_O\) for every \(O\in \mathcal F_{00}\).
</p><!-- l. 1755 --><p class='indent'>   We claim that any two elements \(O,O'\in \mathcal F_{00}\) are compatible.

</p><!-- l. 1771 --><p class='indent'>   For this, let \(\epsilon \) be given and let \(\mathbb A_\epsilon \) be the corresponding amoeba forcing. For each \(A\in \mathcal F\) we

Since \(A\) is null we can
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
find an open set \(U\) such that \(A\subset U\) and \(m(U)&lt;\epsilon -m(O)\). Then \(m(O\cup U)&lt;\epsilon \) and \(A\subset O\cup U\), and so \(O\cup U\) is stronger than \(O\) and \(O\cup U\in D_A\). (Kunen says:
The amoeba \(O\) reached out a pseudopod \(U\) to engulf the morsel of food \(A\).)
</p><!-- l. 1776 --><p class='indent'>   Now  by  MA  there  is  a  filter  \(G\subset \mathbb A_\epsilon \)  such  that  \(G\)  meets  \(D_A\)  for  all  \(A\in \mathcal F\).  Letting  \(U=\bigcup G\)  be  the  open  set
determined  by  \(G\),  we  clearly  have  that  \(\bigcup \mathcal F\subset U\).  To  conclude,  we  claim  that  \(m(U)\leq \epsilon \).  For  this,  since  \(\mathbb R\)  is
second  countable  we  can  find  countably  many  elements  \(O_1,O_2,\cdots \in G\)  such  that  \(U=\bigcup O_n\).  Since  measure  is

   <h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>§16. </span> <a id='x1-2200016'></a>The machinery of forcing</h3>
<!-- l. 1794 --><p class='noindent'>So far we have seen forcing only in the context of appeals to Martin’s axiom, which gives us
highly generic filters \(G\) in a single model \(V\) of set theory. When we actually do forcing, we wish to
find a fully generic filter \(G\), even though we know this must lie outside of \(V\). But what does it mean
that a set \(G\) lies outside of the universe of sets? In fact, to find “new” sets \(G\) we will really assume
that \(V\) is a countable, transitive model of ZFC. In other words \(V\) is a countable set lying in some
larger universe \(W\), \(V\) is closed downwards under \(\in \), and the structure \((V,\in )\) satisfies all of the axioms of set
theory.
</p><!-- l. 1796 --><p class='indent'>   The mild assumption that there is such a \(V\) turns out to be very powerful. First of all, if \(V\) is
countable then given a partial order \(\PP \in V\) we can easily find a filter \(G\subset \PP \) that meets all the dense subsets of
\(\PP \) that actually lie in \(V\). After all there are just countably many sets in \(V\) and therefore just countably
many dense subsets of \(\mathbb P\) in \(V\). Hence we can use the argument of Proposition <a href='#x1-20005r5'>14.5<!-- tex4ht:ref: prop:ma-aleph0  --></a> to diagonalize
and obtain a \(V\)-generic filter \(G\).
</p><!-- l. 1798 --><p class='indent'>   Second of all, if \(V\) is transitive then we can use the machinery of absoluteness to reason about
the basic properties of \(V\) and its forcing extensions \(V[G]\). Recall that a formula \(\phi \) in the language of set
theory is \(\Delta _0\) if all of its quantifiers are bounded, that is, of the form \(\exists x\in y\) or else \(\forall x\in y\). We will use the
well-known fact that if \(\phi \) is a \(\Delta _0\) formula with parameters in a transitive set \(A\), then \(\phi \) is true if and only
if \(\phi \) holds in \((A,\in )\).
</p><!-- l. 1800 --><p class='indent'>   So just how mild is the assumption that there is a countable transitive model of ZFC?
Unfortunatley it is not a totally nontrivial one. The countability isn’t the problem; recall that by
the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem if there is an infinite model of a theory \(T\) then there is a
countable one. Rather, the problem is assuming there is a model of ZFC at all. Indeed this is
equivalent to assuming that ZFC is consistent, that is, ZFC does not entail any contradictions. But
we know from Gödel’s incompleteness theorem that it is not possible to establish the
consistency of ZFC using ZFC alone.
</p><!-- l. 1802 --><p class='indent'>   It is possible to work around this technicality by supposing only that \(V\) satisfies a large but
finite subsystem of ZFC. By the reflection theorem, one may obtain transitive set models of such
a subsystem, and it is not difficult to use such a model to get a countable transitive one.
However, for simplicity we will simply assume for the rest of this section that \(V\) is a countable,
transitive model of all of ZFC.
</p><!-- l. 1806 --><p class='indent'>   The first problem we have to deal with when introducing forcing is that if one is working in \(V\),
then since \(G\) is not available it is difficult to refer to elements of \(V[G]\) (and hence difficult to prove facts
about them). Instead we have the following notion of a name of a “potential” element in
\(V[G]\).

each node with a \(\mathbb 1\). To see that \(\check x_G=x\), suppose inductively that \(\check y_G=y\) for all \(y\in x\). Then since \(\mathbb 1\) always lies

will be surjective onto \(\omega \). Thus we can say \(\mathbb 1\forces \) “\(\bigcup \Gamma \) is a surjective function from \(\check \omega \to \check \omega \).” (Recall that we

name for the set \(a_0=\set {x\in a\mid \phi (x,b)}\). For this, let \(\dot a,\dot b\) be names for \(a,b\) respectively, and let \[\rho =\set {(\pi ,p)\mid \pi \in \dom \dot a,\;p\in \mathbb P,\;p\forces \pi \in \dot a,\text { and }p\forces \phi (\pi ,\dot b)}\text {.} \] Here we are using the

is \(p\in G\) such that \(p\forces \pi \in \dot a\) and \(p\forces \phi (\pi ,\dot b)\). By definition of \(\forces \), it follows that in \(V[G]\) we have both \(\pi _G\in \dot a_G\) and \(\phi (\pi _G,\dot b_G)\). In other words,
in \(V[G]\) we have both \(\pi _G\in a\) and \(\phi (\pi _G,b)\), and therefore \(\pi _G\in a_0\).

circular. For example \(\sigma \in \tau \) is defined in terms of equality, which after negating is defined in terms of \(\notin \),
which after negating is defined in terms of \(\in \). The key thing to notice is that when we encounter \(\in \)
for the second time, we have names of lower complexity than before. Since the class of names is
well-founded, the recursion is well-defined.
</p><!-- l. 1999 --><p class='indent'>   Second, while the clauses in Definition <a href='#x1-24001r1'>18.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: defn:forces-0  --></a> are inspired by properties of \(\forces \), they are actually
somewhat oversimplified. For example, comparing clause (5) with Lemma <a href='#x1-23014r8'>17.8<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:forcing-exists  --></a> we see that
clause (5) does not reflect the general case. It turns out that \(\forces _0\) is nearly but not fully equivalent to \(\forces \);
this will still be enough to complete our proof.
</p><!-- l. 2003 --><p class='indent'>   We now turn to the proof of the forcing theorems, which will unfold over the
next several lemmas. The first of these states that the analog of Lemma <a href='#x1-23012r6'>17.6<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:forcing-downward  --></a> holds for
\(\forces _0\).

\(\sigma ,\tau \) are names and that the lemma holds for the sentence \(\sigma '=\sigma \) whenever \(\sigma '\in \dom (\tau )\). Then if \(p\forces _0\sigma \in \tau \), there is \((\sigma ',q)\in \tau \) such
that \(p\leq q\) and \(p\forces _0\sigma '=\sigma \). If also \(p'\leq p\), then clearly also \(p'\leq q\) and by inductive hypothesis \(p'\forces _0\sigma '=\sigma \). Hence \(p'\forces _0\sigma \in \tau \), as desired. The

   Proof. </span>Once again we prove this by induction on the complexity of \(\phi \). To check that
the induction passes through the first clause of Definition <a href='#x1-24001r1'>18.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: defn:forces-0  --></a>, suppose that \(\sigma ,\tau \) are names
and that the lemma holds for the sentence \(\sigma '=\sigma \) whenever \(\sigma '\in \dom (\tau )\). We must show that the lemma
holds for the sentence \(\sigma \in \tau \). For this, first suppose that \(p\in G\) and \(p\forces _0\sigma \in \tau \). Then by Definition <a href='#x1-24001r1'>18.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: defn:forces-0  --></a> there
exists \((\sigma ',q)\in \tau \) such that \(p\leq q\) and \(p\forces _0\sigma '=\sigma \). Clearly \(V[G]\) satisfies \(\sigma '\in \tau \), and by the inductive hypothesis \(V[G]\) also satisfies \(\sigma '=\sigma \). It
follows that \(V[G]\) satisfies \(\sigma \in \tau \).
</p><!-- l. 2024 --><p class='indent'>   Conversely, suppose that \(V[G]\) satisfies \(\sigma \in \tau \). Then there must be some \((\sigma ',q)\in \tau \) such that \(V[G]\) satisfies \(\sigma '=\sigma \). By
the inductive hypothesis, there exists \(r\in G\) such that \(r\forces _0\sigma '=\sigma \). Since \(G\) is downwards-directed we can
find \(p\in G\) such that \(p\leq q,r\). Then by Lemma <a href='#x1-24002r2'>18.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:forcing-downward-0  --></a>, \(p\forces _0\sigma '=\sigma \), and so by Definition <a href='#x1-24001r1'>18.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: defn:forces-0  --></a> we have \(p\forces _0\sigma \in \tau \).
</p><!-- l. 2026 --><p class='indent'>   The verification that the induction goes through the second, fourth, and fifth clauses
of Definition <a href='#x1-24001r1'>18.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: defn:forces-0  --></a> is similar and we leave them for Exercise <a href='#x1-24007r2'>18.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: exerc:forcing-clauses-245  --></a>.
</p><!-- l. 2028 --><p class='indent'>   Finally, we verify that the induction passes through the third clause of Definition <a href='#x1-24001r1'>18.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: defn:forces-0  --></a>.
So suppose the lemma is true for \(\phi \), and let us show it holds for \(\neg \phi \). For this, first suppose that
there is \(p\in G\) such that \(p\forces _0\neg \phi \). Then for all \(q\leq p\) we have \(q\not \forces _0\phi \). It follows from Lemma <a href='#x1-24002r2'>18.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:forcing-downward-0  --></a> that for all \(q\in G\) we
have \(q\not \forces _0\phi \). By inductive hypothesis, we must have that \(V[G]\) does not satisfy \(\phi \), and hence \(V[G]\) satisfies \(\neg \phi \).
</p><!-- l. 2030 --><p class='indent'>   Conversely suppose that \(V[G]\) satisfies \(\neg \phi \). Then \(V[G]\) does not satisfy \(\phi \), so by inductive hypothesis,
for all \(p\in G\) we have \(p\not \forces _0\phi \). We now consider the set \[D=\set {p\in \PP \mid p\forces _0\phi \text { or }p\forces _0\neg \phi }\text {.} \] Then \(D\) is dense: given any \(p\), if \(p\forces _0\neg \phi \) then \(p\) itself lies in \(D\).
Otherwise \(p\not \forces _0\neg \phi \), so by the third clause of Definition <a href='#x1-24001r1'>18.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: defn:forces-0  --></a>, there is \(q\leq p\) such that \(q\forces _0\phi \). Thus in this case \(q\in D\),
and we have verified \(D\) is dense. Finally, since \(G\) is \(V\)-generic there exists \(p\in G\cap D\). Since we know \(p\not \forces _0\phi \), we
must have instead that \(p\forces _0\neg \phi \), as desired. <span class='qed'>□</span>

<!-- l. 2036 --><p class='indent'>   We observe that the key use of the genericity of \(G\) is in the above very clever verification that

for all \(q\leq p\) there exists \(r\leq q\) such that \(r\forces _0\phi \). So let \(q\leq p\) be given, and let \(G\) be a \(V\)-generic filter such that \(q\in G\). The
since \(q\forces \phi \) we have \(V[G]\) satisfies \(\phi \). By Lemma <a href='#x1-24003r3'>18.3<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:forcing-theorem-0  --></a> there exists \(q'\in G\) such that \(q'\forces _0\phi \). Finally we may let \(r\in G\) with

   Proof. </span>Let \(G\subset \PP \) be a \(V\)-generic filter, and let \(g=\bigcup G\). Now, for any limit ordinal \(\alpha &lt;\kappa \) we let \(f_\alpha \in \omega ^\omega \) be the
function defined by \(f_\alpha (n)=g(\alpha +n)\). It is clear that there are \(\kappa \) many of these functions. We claim that if \(\alpha \neq \beta \)
then \(f_\alpha \neq g_\alpha \). Indeed, consider the set \[D_{\alpha ,\beta }=\set {s\in \PP \mid (\exists n\in \omega )\;g(\alpha +n)\neq g(\beta +n)}\text {.} \] Then \(D_{\alpha ,\beta }\) is dense: indeed, given \(s\in \Fn (\kappa ,\omega )\), since \(s\) is finite we can find \(n\in \omega \)
such that neither \(\alpha +n\) nor \(\beta +n\) lies in the domain of \(s\). Then if we let \(t\in \Fn (\kappa ,\omega )\) be an extension of \(s\) such that \(t(\alpha +n)\neq t(\beta +n)\),
we clearly have \(t\in D_{\alpha ,\beta }\).
</p><!-- l. 2104 --><p class='indent'>   Now since \(G\) is \(V\)-generic, there exists \(s\in G\cap D_{\alpha ,\beta }\). Then there exists \(n\in \omega \) such that \(s(\alpha +n)\neq s(\beta +n)\). Since \(s\subset g\) it follows that
\(g(\alpha +n)\neq g(\beta +n)\) and therefore that \(f_\alpha \neq f_\beta \), as desired. <span class='qed'>□</span>

<!-- l. 2107 --><p class='indent'>   Thus if we force with \(\Fn (\kappa ,\omega )\), then in \(V[G]\) we can say for certain that \(\mathfrak c\geq |\kappa |\). However before we can say for
sure that \(V[G]\) satisfies \(\neg \)CH, we need to be very careful about the cardinal value of \(\kappa \). As we saw in
Section <a href='#x1-1900013'>13<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:idea-forcing  --></a>, it is possible for forcing to collapse cardinals. Even if in \(V\) we started with \(\kappa \)

the downwards-directed property of \(G\) we can assume that \(q\leq p\), and hence obtain that \(b\in F(a)\).

   Proof. </span>Since there are only countably many possible values of \(|F|\) for \(F\in \mathcal F\), by the pigeonhole
principle we can replace \(\mathcal F\) with an uncountable subset of it such that \(|F|=\) some fixed value \(n\) for
all \(F\in \mathcal G\).

suppose that the claim is true for families of sets of size \(&lt;n\). First consider the case that there
is some \(\alpha \in \kappa \) which lies in uncountably many of the \(F\in \mathcal G\). Then by the inductive hypothesis we can
find a delta system \(\mathcal H_0\) contained in \(\set {F\smallsetminus \{\alpha \}\mid F\in \mathcal G}\). It follows that the family \(\mathcal G_0=\set {F_0\cup \{\alpha \}\mid F_0\in \mathcal H_0}\) is a delta system too.
</p><!-- l. 2156 --><p class='indent'>   Second consider the case that every \(\alpha \in \kappa \), is contained in just countably many of the \(F\in \mathcal G\). Then
we can inductively find an uncountable subfamily \(\mathcal G_0\subset \mathcal G\) that is pairwise disjoint, and hence a
delta system with empty root. Indeed, if countably many pairwise disjoint sets \(F_0,F_1,\ldots \) have been
found so far, then all the ordinals in \(\bigcup F_n\) are still only contained in countably many of the \(F\in \mathcal G\).
This means that we can find an \(F\) disjoint from them all, and completes the proof of the
claim. <span class='qed'>□</span>

in \(V\). To begin, by the forcing theorem we can find some \(q\in G\) such that \(q\forces \dot f\colon \check \omega \to \check \omega \). Now, since \(f(0)\) has some
value in \(\omega \), there is some \(n_0\in \omega \) such that \(V[G]\) satisfies \(f(0)=\check n_0\). Hence we can find \(p_0\in G\) and such that \(p_0\forces \dot f(0)=\check n_0\). Moreover
since \(G\) is downwards directed, we can suppose without loss of generality that \(p_0\leq q\).
</p><!-- l. 2213 --><p class='indent'>   Repeating this argument inductivley, we can find \(n_i\in \omega \) and \(p_i\in G\) such that \(p_i\forces f(\check i)=\check n_i\). Moreover we can
assume that \(p_i\leq p_{i-1}\) for all \(i\). Since \(\PP \) is countably closed, there exists \(p\in \PP \) such that \(p\leq p_i\) for all \(i\). Then \(p\forces \dot f(\check i)=\check n_i\) for
all \(i\), which means that \(p\) “knows” every value of \(f\). It follows that \(f\) is definable in \(V\) by \(f(i)=n\) if and
only if \(p\forces \dot f(\check i)=\check n\).
</p><!-- l. 2215 --><p class='indent'>   To see that \(\PP \) does not collapse \(\aleph _1\), let \(\kappa \) denote the ordinal such that in \(V\) we have \(\aleph _1=\kappa \), and
suppose towards a contradiction that in \(V[G]\) we have that \(\kappa \) is countable. Then in \(V[G]\) there is a
surjective function \(f\colon \omega \to \kappa \). Note that in the argument of the previous paragraph we only needed
that the domain of \(f\) was \(\omega \) and the codomain of \(f\) was a set in \(V\). Hence we can use the same

dense: indeed, if \(s\) is element of \(\Fn _{\aleph _0}(\omega _1,\omega )\) then we can find some \(\alpha \) such that \(\dom (s)&lt;\alpha \), and define an extension
\(t\supset s\) such that \(t(\alpha +n)=s(n)\).

that in \(V[G]\) there are at most \(\kappa \) many subsets of \(\omega \). To this end, we claim that every subset of \(\omega \) in \(V[G]\)
has a nice name, that is, a name of the form \[\tau =\set {(\check n,p)\mid p\in A_n}\text {,} \] where for each \(n\), \(A_n\) is an antichain of \(\PP \).
</p><!-- l. 2242 --><p class='indent'>   Admitting this claim, since \(\PP \) is ccc, we know that each antichain \(A_n\) is countable. It follows
that there are only \(\kappa ^{\aleph _0}\) many possibilities for the name \(\tau \), and hence only \(\kappa ^{\aleph _0}\) many possibilities
for the set \(S\). Since we have assumed that \(\kappa ^{\aleph _0}=\kappa \), this completes the proof.
</p><!-- l. 2244 --><p class='indent'>   To establish the claim, let \(S\in V[G]\) be a subset of \(\omega \) and let \(\dot S\) be a name for \(S\). By the forcing theorem
there is some \(q\in G\) such that \(q\forces \dot S\subset \check \omega \). Now consider the sets \[B_n=\set {p\in \PP \mid p\leq q\text { and }p\forces \check n\in \dot S} \] Using Zorn’s Lemma, we can find a
maximal antichain \(A_n\subset B_n\). We will show that the corresponding nice name \(\tau \) is a name for \(S\).
</p><!-- l. 2249 --><p class='indent'>   First, it is clear that \(\tau _G\subset S\), since if \((\check n,p)\in G\) then \(p\forces \check n\in \dot S\) and hence \(V[G]\) satisfies \(n\in S\). Conversely, suppose that \(V[G]\)
satisfies \(n\in S\) and let \(q'\in G\) be such that \(q'\forces \check n\in \dot S\). As usual since \(G\) is downwards directed we can suppose that
\(q'\leq q\). We now consider the set \[D=\set {p\in \PP \mid p\perp q'\text { or }(\exists a\in A_n)\;p\leq a}\text {.} \] Then \(D\) is dense: given any \(p_0\in \PP \), if \(p_0\) is incompatible with \(q'\), then \(p_0\) itself
lies in \(D\). Otherwise \(p_0\) is compatible with \(q'\) and hence there is \(p_1\leq p_0,q'\). Then \(p_1\) lies in the set \(B_n\), and since
\(A_n\) is a maximal antichain in \(B_n\), we must have that \(p_1\) is compatible with some \(a\in A_n\). Hence we can
find \(p_2\leq p_1,a\), and then \(p_2\in D\).
</p><!-- l. 2254 --><p class='indent'>   Finally, since \(G\) is generic, there is some \(p\in G\) and an element \(a\in A_n\) with \(p\leq a\). Since \(G\) is closed upwards,
\(a\in G\) too, and since \((\check n,a)\in \tau \) we have \(n\in \tau _G\). This shows that \(S\subset \tau _G\), as desired. <span class='qed'>□</span>

we consider just the cardinals associtaed with the domination order \(\leq ^*\), namely \(\mathfrak b\) and
\(\mathfrak d\).
</p><!-- l. 2273 --><p class='indent'>   Before we study the effect of the \(\kappa \)-sized Cohen forcing \(\Fn (\kappa ,\omega )\), we first examine the effect of the
countable Cohen forcing \(\Fn (\omega ,\omega )\). The key result is the following lemma, which showcases the
narrow window that Cohen forcing occupies with respect to the domination order
\(\leq ^*\).

</p><!-- l. 2287 --><p class='indent'>   For the second statement, let \(h\in V[G]\) and let \(\dot h\) be a \(\PP \)-name for \(h\). We wish to define a function \(f\in V\)
which is not dominated by \(h\). For this, since \(\PP \) is countable, we can enumerate \(\PP =\{p_i\mid i\in \omega \}\). For each \(i\), we
then define the approximation to \(h\) given by \[h_i(n)=\max \set {m\in \omega \mid p_i\forces \check m\leq \dot h(\check n)}\text {.} \] (If the above maximum is undefined, then set
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
\(h_i(n)=0\) by default.) We now diagonalize against these approximations to \(h\) to define a function \(f\)
such that \(h_i&lt;^*f\) for all \(i\). Specifically we let \[f(n)=\max \set {h_0(n),\ldots ,h_n(n)}+1\text {,} \] and observe that \(f\) lies in \(V\) by the definability theorem.
We claim that this \(f\) is in fact not dominated by \(h\).
</p><!-- l. 2295 --><p class='indent'>   For  this,  if  we  have  \(f\leq ^*h\)  then  we  can  find  \(N\)  such  that  for  all  \(n\geq N\)  we  have  \(f(n)\leq h(n)\).  By  the  forcing
theorem, we can find \(p_i\in \PP \) such that \(p_i\forces (\forall n\geq \check N)\;\check f(n)\leq \dot h(n)\). But now if we choose any \(n\geq N,i\), then by definition of \(h_i\) we have

and \(G_2=G\cap \PP _2\). Then \(G_1\) is \(V\)-generic for \(\PP _1\), \(G_2\) is \(V[G_1]\)-generic for \(\PP _2\), and \(V[G]=V[G_1][G_2]\).

<!-- l. 2303 --><p class='indent'>

   <div class='proof'>
<!-- l. 2306 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='head'>
   Proof. </span>It is straightforward to verify that \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) are filters. Moreover, since \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) are
defined from \(G\), and \(G\) can be recovered from \(G_1\) and \(G_2\), it follows easily that \(V[G]=V[G_1][G_2]\).
</p><!-- l. 2308 --><p class='indent'>   To show that \(G_1\) is \(V\)-generic for \(\PP _1\), let \(D\in V\) be a dense subset of \(\PP _1\). Letting \[D'=\set {p\cup q\mid p\in \PP _1,\;q\in \PP _2,\text { and }p\in D}\text {,} \] it is trivial to see that
\(D'\) is dense in \(\PP \). Since \(G\) is \(V\)-generic for \(\PP \), there exists an element \(p\cup q\in G\cap D'\). Then \(p\in D\), and since \(G\) is closed
upwards, we have \(p\in G\) too. Thus \(G\cap D\neq \emptyset \), as desired.
</p><!-- l. 2313 --><p class='indent'>   To show that \(G_2\) is \(V[G_1]\)-generic for \(\PP _2\) is analogous but slightly trickier. For this, let \(D\in V[G_1]\) be a dense
subset of \(\PP _2\), and let \(\dot D\) be a \(\PP _1\)-name for \(D\). Using the forcing theorem, we can find \(p_1\in G_1\) such that \(p_1\forces \)
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
“\(\dot D\) is dense in \(\check \PP _2\)”. Let \[D'=\set {p\cup q\mid p\in \PP _1,\;q\in \PP _2,\text { and either $p\perp p_1$ or else $p\leq p_1$ and $p\forces \check q\in \dot D$}} \] We claim that \(D'\) is dense in \(\PP \). Indeed, let \(p\cup q\) be an arbitrary element of \(\PP \),
where \(p\in \PP _1\) and \(q\in \PP _2\). If \(p\perp p_1\) then we are done, so suppose instead that \(p\leq p_1\). Since \(D\) is dense in \(\PP _2\), there exists \(q'\leq q\)
such that \(q'\in D\). Then by the forcing theorem there exists \(p'\in G_1\) such that \(p'\forces \check q'\in \dot D\). Letting \(p''\leq p,p'\), we have that \(p''\cup q'\in D'\), as
desired.
</p><!-- l. 2318 --><p class='indent'>   Now, since \(G\) is \(V\)-generic for \(\PP \), there exists an element \(p\cup q\in G\cap D'\). Then \(q\in G_2\), and by definition of \(D'\) we
have that \(q\in D\) too. Thus again we have \(G_2\cap D\neq \emptyset \), as desired. <span class='qed'>□</span>

   Proof. </span>We first show that \(\mathfrak d=\kappa \). Recall that we already know that \(\mathfrak d\leq \mathfrak c=\kappa \). Now suppose, towards
a contradiction, that \(\mathfrak d&lt;\kappa \). That is, in \(V[G]\) there exists a dominating family \(\mathcal F\) such that \(|\mathcal F|&lt;\kappa \). We claim
that there is some \(I\subset \kappa \) such that \(|I|&lt;\kappa \) and \(\mathcal F\) is added by the forcing \(\Fn (I,\omega )\).
</p><!-- l. 2331 --><p class='indent'>   To establish the claim, we first code \(\mathcal F\) as a subset of \(\lambda \times \omega \times \omega \) by enumerating \(\mathcal F=\set {f_\alpha \mid \beta &lt;\lambda }\) and letting \[S_{\mathcal F}=\set {(\beta ,n,m)\mid f_\beta (n)=m} \] Now
let \(\tau \) be a nice name for \(S_{\mathcal F}\) (see the proof of Theorem <a href='#x1-27005r5'>20.5<!-- tex4ht:ref: thm:ch-exact  --></a>), and note that since \(\PP \) is ccc there
are at most \(\lambda \) many elements of \(\PP \) mentioned in \(\tau \). Each of these \(\lambda \) many elements of \(\PP \) in turn
has just finitely many ordinals in its domain. Letting \(I\) be the union of all these domains,
we have that \(\tau \) is a \(\Fn (I,\omega )\)-name and hence is added by the forcing \(\Fn (I,\omega )\).
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
</p><!-- l. 2336 --><p class='indent'>   We now reach a contradiction as follows. Let \(\PP _1=\Fn (I,\omega )\), \(G_1=G\cap \PP _1\), \(\PP _2=\Fn (\kappa \smallsetminus I,\omega )\), and \(G_2=G\cap \PP _2\). Then the dominating family
\(\mathcal F\) lies in \(V[G_1]\). But forcing with \(\PP _2\) over \(V[G_1]\) adds the generic element \(g_2=\bigcup G_2\) to the Baire space. Applying
Lemma <a href='#x1-28001r1'>21.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:cohen-dominating  --></a> to the ground model \(V[G_1]\), we see that \(g_2\) is not dominated by any element of \(V[G_1]\), a
contradiction.
</p><!-- l. 2338 --><p class='indent'>   We now turn to the proof that \(\mathfrak b=\aleph _1\). Since the Baire space of the ground model, \(\omega ^\omega \cap V\), is itself a
family of size \(\aleph _1\), it suffices to show that \(\omega ^\omega \cap V\) remains unbounded in \(V[G]\). So suppose to the contrary
that some \(h\in V[G]\) is a bound for \(\omega ^\omega \cap V\).
</p><!-- l. 2340 --><p class='indent'>   We first show that we can suppose \(h\) is added by a countable fragment of the forcing \(\PP \).
For this, let \(\dot h\) be a nice name for \(h\subset \omega \times \omega \). Then once again since \(\PP \) is ccc, \(\dot h\) mentions just countably
many elements of \(\PP \) and these elements each use just finitely many elements of the domain
\(\kappa \). Hence there exists a countable subset \(I\subset \kappa \) such that \(h\) is already added by the partial order \(\PP _1=\Fn (I,\omega )\).

parts of Lemma <a href='#x1-28001r1'>21.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:cohen-dominating  --></a>, where the \(\leq ^*\) relation is replaced by the “different” relation.
</p><!-- l. 2403 --><p class='indent'>   For the first statement, let \(P=(I_n)\) be an interval partition and \(x\in \omega ^\omega \), with \(P,x\in V\). For each \(N\in \omega \) let \[D_N=\set {s\in \PP \mid (\exists n\geq N)\;s\restriction I_n=x\restriction I_n}\text {.} \] Then it is
easy to see that \(D_N\) is dense: given \(s\in \PP \) one can choose \(n\) large enough so that \(I_n\cap \dom (s)=\emptyset \), and then extend \(s\)
to \(I_n\) as required. It follows that \(g\) has the property that for all \(N\) there exists \(n\geq N\) such that \(g\restriction I_n=x\restriction I_n\). This
means precisely that \(g\) does not lie in \(\Diff _P(x)\).
</p><!-- l. 2408 --><p class='indent'>   For the second statement, let \(Q=(J_n)\) be an interval partition and \(y\in \omega ^\omega \), with both \(Q,y\in V[G]\). Let \(\dot Q\) and \(\dot y\) be

construction there exists \(n\geq N\) and \(q\leq p\) such that \(q\forces \dot y\restriction J_n=\check x\restriction J_n\). This is a contradiction, since \(q\) is an extension of \(p\)

<!-- l. 2448 --><p class='noindent'>The previous section provided one possible picture of Cichoń’s diagram after forcing: the left
half of the diagram is small, the right half large. It turns out that many other configurations can
be achieved with more creative forcing partial orders. In this section we begin to explore the
effect of random forcing which, as we will see, does for measure what Cohen forcing did for
category.
</p><!-- l. 2450 --><p class='indent'>   The random forcing partial order can be defined on any of the spaces \(\R \), \(2^\omega \), or \(\omega ^\omega \), but in order to
generalize it later we will define it on Cantor space \(2^\omega \). Recall that we use the “coin-tossing”
measure on \(2^\omega \), which is defined analogously to the Lebesgue measure of Equation (??) but with
the length \(\ell \) replaced by the probability \(m(V_s)=2^{-|s|}\). Thus we have \[m(A)=\inf \set {\sum 2^{-|s_n|}\left |\; A\subset \bigcup V_{s_n}\right .} \] As usual, the function \(m\) has the properties
of a measure on a class of sets containing all Borel sets. The null ideal \(\Null \) on \(2^\omega \) consists of those \(A\) for
which \(m(A)=0\).

  23.1. Definition.  </span>The random forcing partial order \(\Nonnull (2^\omega )\) consists of equivalence classes \([A]\)
of nonnull (Borel) subsets \(A\subset 2^\omega \). Here, two subsets \(A\) and \(B\) are called equivalent iff the symmetric
difference \(A\mathbin {\vartriangle } B\) is null. The set \(\Nonnull (2^\omega )\) is partially ordered by \([A]\leq [B]\) iff \(A\smallsetminus B\) is null.
</p>
   </div>
<!-- l. 2457 --><p class='indent'>
</p><!-- l. 2459 --><p class='indent'>   The random forcing partial order is also a Boolean algebra, which means that we can take
pairwise joins (unions), meets (intersections), and complements. Although we will not develop
the theory here, it turns out that any partial order is forcing equivalent to a Boolean algebra. For
example, Cohen forcing \(\Fn (\omega ,2)\) is equivalent to the partial order consisting of equivalence classes
of nonmeager subsets of \(2^\omega \), where sets are equivalent if their symmetric difference is
meager.
</p><!-- l. 2461 --><p class='indent'>   Like Cohen forcing, if \(G\) is a \(V\)-generic filter for random forcing then there is a corresponding
generic element \(g\in 2^\omega \). In order to define \(g\), first observe that for each \(n\) the elements \([V_s]\) for \(|s|=n\) form a maximal
antichain of \(\Nonnull (2^\omega )\). It follows that for each \(n\), there is exactly one \([V_s]\in G\) with \(|s|=n\). We may then let \[g=\bigcup \set {s\mid [V_s]\in G} \] This is
well-defined since the elements of \(G\) are pairwise compatible.
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
</p><!-- l. 2466 --><p class='indent'>   Just as the Cohen generic real lies in every comeager set coded in the ground model, this
generic \(g\) is “random” in the sense that it lies in every conull set coded in the ground model.
Before showing this, we should say precisely what we mean by this coding. While it is
possible to code arbitrary Borel sets, for simplicity we will state the result only for \(G_\delta \)
sets.
</p><!-- l. 2468 --><p class='indent'>   Recall that a subset of \(2^\omega \) is called \(G_\delta \) if it is a countable intersection of open sets. Thus any \(G_\delta \)
set \(A\) can be expressed as \(\bigcap _m\bigcup _nV_{s_{n,m}}\), and we say that the sequence \(\{s_{n,m}\}\) is a code for \(A\). If \(V[G]\) is a forcing
extension of \(V\) and \(A\) is a \(G_\delta \) set of \(V\) coded by \(\{s_{n,m}\}\), then we let \(A^*\) be the \(G_\delta \) set in \(V[G]\) with the same

  23.2. Lemma.  </span> Let \(\PP =\Nonnull (2^\omega )\), let \(G\) be \(V\)-generic, and \(g\) the corresponding generic element of \(2^\omega \). Suppose \(A\) is
a \(G_\delta \) set of \(V\), and let \(A^*\) be the interpretation of \(A\) in \(V[G]\). Then if \(A\) is conull then \(g\) lies in \(A^*\), and if \(A\) is null then \(g\)
lies in the complement of \(A^*\).

   <div class='proof'>
<!-- l. 2476 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='head'>
   Proof. </span>Assume that \(A\) is conull. We first treat the case that \(A\) is open, so that there is a
sequence of basic open sets \(V_{s_n}\) such that \(A=\bigcup _nV_{s_n}\). Consider the set \[D=\set {[B]\in \PP \mid (\exists n)\;B\subset V_{s_n}} \] Then \(D\) is dense: any nonnull \(B\) has
nonnull intersection with some \(V_{s_n}\) and therefore \([B\cap V_{s_n}]\) is an element of \(\PP \) which lies in \(D\). Since \(G\) is
generic, there is some \(n\) such that \([V_{s_n}]\) lies in \(G\). By definition of \(g\), it follows that \(g\in V_{s_n}\) and therefore \(g\in A^*\).
</p><!-- l. 2481 --><p class='indent'>   Returning to the case that \(A\) is \(G_\delta \), there is a sequence \(A_m\) of open sets such that \(A=\bigcap _mA_m\). Then for all
\(m\), \(A_m\) is conull, so the previous paragraph implies that \(g\in A_m^*\). Thus \(g\in A^*\), as desired.
</p><!-- l. 2483 --><p class='indent'>   Finally assume that \(A\) is null. Then \(A^c\) is a conull set of the form \(\bigcup _m\bigcap _nV_{s_{n,m}}\). By a similar dense set
argument, one of the sets \(A_m=\bigcap _nV_{s_{n,m}}\) must satisfy \([A_m]\in G\). Thus for this \(m\), we have that for all \(n\), \([V_{s_{n,m}}]\in G\) and hence \(g\in V_{s_{n,m}}\).
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
This means precisely that \(g\in \bigcup _m\bigcap _nV_{s_{n,m}}\), as interpreted in \(V[G]\). Thus \(g\) is in the complement of \(A^*\). <span class='qed'>□</span>
</p>
   </div>
<!-- l. 2486 --><p class='indent'>   As we mentioned, this result can be stated for Borel sets \(A\) as well; one simply uses induction
to reach sets with more complex codes. Meanwhile it follows from Lemma <a href='#x1-30002r2'>23.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:random-conull  --></a> that
the random real \(g\) is new. Indeed, if \(y\) is any element of the ground model \(V\), consider
the conull \(G_\delta \) set \(A=2^\omega \smallsetminus \{y\}\) (in fact it is open). Then \(g\) lies in \(A^*\), which is the \(2^\omega \smallsetminus \{y\}\) of \(V[G]\), and in particular
\(g\neq y\).
</p><!-- l. 2488 --><p class='indent'>   Just as Cohen forcing \(\Fn (\omega ,\omega )\) has a \(\kappa \)-sized version \(\Fn (\kappa ,\omega )\), random forcing has a \(\kappa \)-length version \(\Nonnull (2^\kappa )\). Like the
\(\kappa \)-sized Cohen forcing, the \(\kappa \)-sized random forcing adds \(\kappa \) many new elements to Cantor space and
therefore pushes the value of the continuum up to \(\kappa \).
</p><!-- l. 2490 --><p class='indent'>   To make the definition of \(\Nonnull (2^\kappa )\) precise, we recall that the product topology on \(2^\kappa \) has a basis
consisting of the sets \(V_s=\set {x\in 2^\kappa \mid s\subset x}\), where \(s\) is a function from a finite subset of \(\kappa \) to \(\{0,1\}\). The coin-tossing measure
on \(2^\kappa \) is defined by assigning to each \(V_s\) the measure \(2^{-|s|}\) and extending it as before.

   Proof. </span>We first claim that \(\PP \) is ccc, and hence \(\kappa \) remains a cardinal in \(V[G]\). To see this, first
note  that  two  elements  \([A],[B]\)  of  \(\Nonnull (2^\kappa )\)  are  incompatible  if  and  only  if  \(A\cap B\)  is  null.  Thus  it  suffices  to
show that if \(\mathcal F\) is a family pairwise disjoint, nonnull subsets of \(2^\kappa \), then \(\mathcal F\) is countable. For this,
since the full space \(2^\kappa \) has measure \(1\), for each \(n\) there can be just finitely many elements of \(\mathcal F\) of
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
measure \(\geq 1/n\). It follows that there can be just countably many elements of \(\mathcal F\) in total, and so \(\PP \) is
ccc.
</p><!-- l. 2499 --><p class='indent'>   Next, we claim that \(\PP \) adds \(\kappa \) many distinct elements to \(2^\omega \). First, by the definition given
above in the case of \(\Nonnull (2^\omega )\), we can use \(G\) to define a corresponding function \(g\in 2^\kappa \). We then define a
family of \(\kappa \) many elements of \(2^\omega \) by letting \(g_\alpha (n)=g(\alpha +n)\) for every limit ordinal \(\alpha &lt;\kappa \). Then the \(g_\alpha \) are pairwise
distinct because this happens with probability one. More precisely, for any distinct limit
ordinals \(\alpha ,\beta &lt;\kappa \) let \[A_{\alpha ,\beta }=\set {x\in 2^\kappa \mid (\forall n)\;x(\alpha +n)=x(\beta +n)}\text {.} \] Then \(A_{\alpha ,\beta }\) is \(G_\delta \) and null. To see that it is null, note that \(A_{\alpha ,\beta }\) is the intersection of the
independent events \[A_{\alpha ,\beta ,n}=\set {x\in 2^\kappa \mid x(\alpha +n)=x(\beta +n)}\text {,} \] Since each of these events has probability \(1/2\), we have \(m(A_{\alpha ,\beta })=\prod _n\frac 12=0\) and so \(A_{\alpha ,\beta }\) is null.
It now follows from Lemma <a href='#x1-30002r2'>23.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:random-conull  --></a> (adapted to length \(\kappa \)) that \(g\) lies in the complement of \(A_{\alpha ,\beta }\)
(interpreted in \(V[G]\)) and therefore that \(g_\alpha \neq g_\beta \).
</p><!-- l. 2507 --><p class='indent'>   We can now conclude that in \(V[G]\) we have \(\mathfrak c\geq \kappa \). Finally since the forcing is ccc, we can repeat
the  argument  from  Theorem <a href='#x1-27005r5'>20.5<!-- tex4ht:ref: thm:ch-exact  --></a>  to  count  nice  names  for  reals  in  \(V[G]\)  and  establish  that  \(V[G]\)

\(p_m\), simply let \(p_m=[\emptyset ]\). Then the collection of \(p_m\) is pairwise incompatible, or in terms of representing

  24.5. Lemma.  </span>Let \(\PP =\Nonnull (2^\kappa )\), and let \(I\subset \kappa \). Then forcing with \(\PP \) is equivalent to forcing with \(\PP _1=\Nonnull (2^I)\) to produce a
generic \(G_1\), followed by forcing with \(\PP _2=\Nonnull (2^{\kappa \smallsetminus I})\) as it is defined in \(V[G_1]\).

   Proof of Theorem <a href='#x1-31005r4'>24.4<!-- tex4ht:ref: thm:random-null  --></a>. </span>  The  proofs  are  analogous  to  the  proofs  of  the  two
equalities in Theorem <a href='#x1-29004r3'>22.3<!-- tex4ht:ref: thm:cohen-meager  --></a>. To show that \(\cov (\Null )=\kappa \), assume to the contrary that \(\cov (\Null )&lt;\kappa \). Then there exists
a cardinal \(\lambda &lt;\kappa \) and a family \(\mathcal F\) of null sets such that \(|\mathcal F|=\lambda \) and \(\bigcup F=2^\omega \).
</p><!-- l. 2617 --><p class='indent'>   Since every null set is contained in a null \(G_\delta \) set, we can suppose that every element of \(\mathcal F\) is
a \(G_\delta \) set. Thus every \(A\in \mathcal F\) has a code, which is a countable collection binary sequences on a finite
subset of \(\kappa \). Using a now-familiar nice name argument, we can find a set \(I\subset \kappa \) with \(|I|=\lambda \) such that if \(\PP _1=\Nonnull (2^I)\)
and \(G_1\) is as above, then the codes for all elements of \(\mathcal F\) appear in \(V[G_1]\).
</p><!-- l. 2619 --><p class='indent'>   But now, the forcing \(\PP _2\) adds a random real \(g\). By Lemma <a href='#x1-30002r2'>23.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:random-conull  --></a> we know that \(g\) does not lie
in any null set coded in \(V[G_1]\). This contradicts that \(\mathcal F\) is a covering family in \(V[G]\).
</p><!-- l. 2621 --><p class='indent'>   To  see  that  \(\non (\Null )=\aleph _1\),  one  can  argue  that  the  ground  model  reals  form  a  nonnull  set  in  the
forcing extension. Alternatively we may let \(g_\alpha \) be the sequence of random reals added by
the forcing, and show that the set \(\mathcal F=\set {g_\alpha \mid \alpha &lt;\omega _1}\) is nonnull in \(V[G]\).
</p><!-- l. 2623 --><p class='indent'>   For this, suppose to the contrary that \(\mathcal F\) is null. Then there is some \(G_\delta \) null set \(A\) such that \(\mathcal F\subset A\).
Once again using a nice name argument, we can find a countable set \(I\subset \kappa \) such that if \(\PP _1=\Nonnull (2^I)\) and \(G_1\) is
as above, then \(A\) appears in \(V[G_1]\).
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
</p><!-- l. 2625 --><p class='indent'>   Finally, since \(\mathcal F\) is uncountable we can find some element \(g_\alpha \in \mathcal F\) which is not added by \(\PP _1\), and
instead added over \(V[G_1]\) by the forcing \(\PP _2\). Once again using Lemma <a href='#x1-30002r2'>23.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: lem:random-conull  --></a>, since \(A\) is a null \(G_\delta \) set in \(V[G_1]\)
we have that \(g_\alpha \) lies in the complement of \(A\) as it is interpreted in \(V[G]\). In particular, \(g_\alpha \) doesn’t lie in
\(\mathcal F\), a contradiction. <span class='qed'>□</span>
